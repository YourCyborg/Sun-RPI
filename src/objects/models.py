"""
This module defines the database models for all in-game objects, that
is, all objects that has an actual existence in-game.

Each database object is 'decorated' with a 'typeclass', a normal
python class that implements all the various logics needed by the game
in question. Objects created of this class transparently communicate
with its related database object for storing all attributes. The
admin should usually not have to deal directly with this database
object layer.

Attributes are separate objects that store values persistently onto
the database object. Like everything else, they can be accessed
transparently through the decorating TypeClass.

    Note that the base objectdb is very simple, with
    few defined fields. Use attributes to extend your
    type class with new database-stored variables.

      key - main name
      name - alias for key

      typeclass - auto-linked typeclass

      player - optional connected player
      location - in-game location of object
      home - safety location for object (handler)

      scripts - scripts assigned to object (handler from typeclass)
      cmdset - active cmdset on object (handler from typeclass)
      aliases - aliases for this object (property)
      nicks - nicknames for *other* things in Evennia (handler)
      sessions - sessions connected to this object (see also player)
      has_player - bool if an active player is currently connected

        use_nicks : Use nickname replace (off by default)
        location : If None, use caller's current location, and caller.contents.
                   This can also be a list of locations
        player: return the Objects' controlling Player, instead, if available
        ignore_errors : Don't display any error messages even
                        if there are none/multiple matches -
                        just return the result as a list.
        exact:  Determines if the search must exactly match the key/alias of the
                given object or if partial matches the beginnings of one or more
                words in the name is enough. Exact matching is faster if using
                global search. Also, if attribute_name is set, matching is always exact.

        Returns - a unique Object/Player match or None. All error
                  messages are handled by system-commands and the parser-handlers
                  specified in settings.

        Use *<string> to search for objects controlled by a specific
        player. Note that the object controlled by the player will be
        returned, not the player object itself. This also means that
        this will not find Players without a character. Use the keyword
        player=True to find player objects.

        Note - for multiple matches, the engine accepts a number
        linked to the key in order to separate the matches from
        each other without showing the dbref explicitly. Default
        syntax for this is 'N-searchword'. So for example, if there
        are three objects in the room all named 'ball', you could
        address the individual ball as '1-ball', '2-ball', '3-ball'
        etc.
