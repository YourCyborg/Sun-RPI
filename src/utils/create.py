"""
This module gathers all the essential database-creation
functions for the game engine's various object types.

Only objects created 'stand-alone' are in here, e.g. object Attributes
are always created directly through their respective objects.

Each creation_* function also has an alias named for the entity being
created, such as create_object() and object().  This is for
consistency with the utils.search module and allows you to do the
shorter "create.object()".

The respective object managers hold more methods for manipulating and
searching objects already existing in the database.

Models covered:
 Objects
 Scripts
 Help
 Message
 Channel
 Players

    If player_dbobj is given, this player object is used instead of

    needs to create the player object in order to relate it automatically
    to the user.

    True, a game player object with the same name as the User/Player will
    also be created. Its typeclass and base properties can also be given.

    Returns the new game character, or the Player obj if no
    character is created.  For more info about the typeclass argument,
    see create_objects() above.

    Note: if user is supplied, it will NOT be modified (args name, email,

    directly on the User instead.

    If no permissions are given (None), the default permission group
    as defined in settings.PERMISSION_PLAYER_DEFAULT will be
