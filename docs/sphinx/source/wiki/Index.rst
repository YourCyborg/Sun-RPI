Evennia Documentation
=====================

This is Evennia's manual. You should hopefully find all you need to know
about coding with, extending and using the codebase among these pages.
If you have trouble with unclear documentation, fill in our quick
`online form <http://tinyurl.com/c4tue23>`_ and tell us so - maybe more
details or a new tutorial is needed!

The documentation is divided into several main categories. If you are
new, it might be an idea to browse the sections in the order they are
listed. If you get stuck or feel the urge to improve things, see the
section on `how to get and give help <HowToGetAndGiveHelp.html>`_.

Sections
--------

-  A `Lengthier introduction <EvenniaIntroduction.html>`_ to what
   Evennia is.

-  The `Getting Started <GettingStarted.html>`_ page helps with
   downloading, installing and setting up Evennia for the first time.
-  The `Administrative Documentation <AdminDocs.html>`_ covers the
   practicalities of running and maintaining an Evennia game once it is
   in place.
-  The `Builder Docs <BuilderDocs.html>`_ section contains instructions
   for starting to build a game world using Evennia.
-  The `Developer Central <DeveloperCentral.html>`_ covers
   implementation details and guides of interest for game-world coders
   as well as for current and prospective Evennia developers.
-  The `Tutorials & Examples <Tutorials.html>`_ section summarizes help
   pages on a step-by-step or tutorial format. Some of these are
   reachable from their respective sections as well.
