The Batch-Command processor
===========================

For an introduction and motivation to using batch processors, see
`here <BatchProcessors.html>`_. This page describes the Batch-*command*
processor. The Batch-*code* one is covered
`here <BatchCodeProcessor.html>`_.

Basic Usage
-----------

The batch-command processor is a superuser-only function, invoked by

::

     > @batchcommand path.to.batchcmdfile

Where ``path.to.batchcmdfile`` is the path to a *batch-command file*
with the "``.ev``\ " file ending. This path is given like a python path
relative to a folder you define to hold your batch files, set with
``BATCH_IMPORT_PATH`` in your settings. Default folder is
``game/gamesrc/world``. So if you want to run the example batch file in
``game/gamesrc/world/examples/batch_cmds.ev``, you could use

::

     > @batchcommand examples.batch_cmds

A batch-command file contains a list of Evennia in-game commands
separated by comments. The processor will run the batch file from
beginning to end. Note that *it will not stop if commands in it fail*
(there is no universal way for the processor to know what a failure
looks like for all different commands). So keep a close watch on the
output, or use *Interactive mode* (see below) to run the file in a more
controlled, gradual manner.

The batch file
--------------

The batch file is a simple plain-text file containing Evennia commands.
Just like you would write them in-game, except you have more freedom
with line breaks.

Here are the rules of syntax of an ``*.ev`` file. You'll find it's
really, really simple:

-  All lines having the ``#`` (hash)-symbol *as the first one on the
   line* are considered *comments*. All non-comment lines are treated as
   a command and/or their arguments.
-  Comment lines have an actual function -- they mark the *end of the
   previous command definition*. So never put two commands directly
   after one another in the file - separate them with a comment, or the
   second of the two will be considered an argument to the first one.
   Besides, using plenty of comments is good practice anyway.
-  A line that starts with the word ``#INSERT`` is a comment line but
   also signifies a special instruction. The syntax is
   ``#INSERT <path.batchfile>`` and tries to import a given batch-cmd
   file into this one. The inserted batch file (file ending ``.ev``)
   will run normally from the point of the ``#INSERT`` instruction.
-  Extra whitespace in a command definition is *ignored*.
-  A completely empty line translates in to a line break in texts. Two
   empty lines thus means a new paragraph (this is obviously only
   relevant for commands accepting such formatting, such as the
   ``@desc`` command).
-  The very last command in the file is not required to end with a
   comment.
-  You *cannot* nest another ``@batchcommand`` statement into your batch
   file. If you want to link many batch-files together, use the
   ``#INSERT`` batch instruction instead. You also cannot launch the
   ``@batchcode`` command from your batch file, the two batch processors
   are not compatible.

Below is a version of the example file found in
``game/gamesrc/commands/examples/batch_cmds.ev``.

::

    #
    # This is an example batch build file for Evennia. 
    #

    # This creates a red button
    @create button:examples.red_button.RedButton
    # (This comment ends input for @create)
    # Next command. Let's create something. 
    @set button/desc = 
      This is a large red button. Now and then 
      it flashes in an evil, yet strangely tantalizing way. 

      A big sign sits next to it. It says:


    -----------

     Press me! 

    -----------


      ... It really begs to be pressed! You 
    know you want to! 

    # This inserts the commands from another batch-cmd file named
    # batch_insert_file.ev.
    #INSERT examples.batch_insert_file

      
    # (This ends the @set command). Note that single line breaks 
    # and extra whitespace in the argument are ignored. Empty lines 
    # translate into line breaks in the output.
    # Now let's place the button where it belongs (let's say limbo #2 is 
    # the evil lair in our example)
    @teleport #2
    # (This comments ends the @teleport command.) 
    # Now we drop it so others can see it. 
    # The very last command in the file needs not be ended with #.
    drop button

To test this, run ``@batchcommand`` on the file. A button will be
created, described and dropped in Limbo. All commands will be executed
by the user calling the command. *Note that if you interact with the
button, you might find that its description changes, loosing your
custom-set description above. This is just the way this particular
object works.*

Interactive mode
----------------

Interactive mode allows you to more step-wise control over how the batch
file is executed. This is useful for debugging and also if you have a
large batch file and is only updating a small part of it -- running the
entire file again would be a waste of time (and in the case of
``@create``-ing objects you would to end up with multiple copies of
same-named objects, for example). Use ``@batchcommand`` with the
``/interactive`` flag to enter interactive mode.

::

     > @batchcommand/interactive examples.batch_cmds

You will see this:

::

    01/04: @create button:examples.red_button.RedButton  (hh for help) 

This shows that you are on the ``@create`` command, the first out of
only four commands in this batch file. Observe that the command
``@create`` has *not* been actually processed at this point!

To take a look at the full command you are about to run, use ``ll`` (a
batch-processor version of ``look``). Use ``pp`` to actually process the
current command (this will actually ``@create`` the button) -- and make
sure it worked as planned. Use ``nn`` (next) to go to the next command.
Use ``hh`` for a list of commands.

If there are errors, fix them in the batch file, then use ``rr`` to
reload the file. You will still be at the same command and can rerun it
easily with ``pp`` as needed. This makes for a simple debug cycle. It
also allows you to rerun individual troublesome commands - as mentioned,
in a large batch file this can be very useful. Do note that in many
cases, commands depend on the previous ones (e.g. if ``@create`` in the
example above had failed, the following commands would have had nothing
to operate on).

Use ``nn`` and ``bb`` (next and back) to step through the file; e.g.
``nn 12`` will jump 12 steps forward (without processing any command in
between). All normal commands of Evennia should work too while working
in interactive mode.

Limitations and Caveats
-----------------------

The batch-command processor is great for automating smaller builds or
for testing new commands and objects repeatedly without having to write
so much. There are several caveats you have to be aware of when using
the batch-command processor for building larger, complex worlds though.

The main issue is that when you run a batch-command script you (*you*,
as in your superuser character) are actually moving around in the game
creating and building rooms in sequence, just as if you had been
entering those commands manually, one by one. You have to take this into
account when creating the file, so that you can 'walk' (or teleport) to
the right places in order.

This also means there are several pitfalls when designing and adding
certain types of objects. Here are some examples:

-  *Rooms that changes your `cmdset <Commands.html>`_*: Imagine that you
   build a 'dark' room, which severely limits the cmdsets of those
   entering it (maybe you have to find the light switch to proceed). In
   your batch script you would create this room, then teleport to it -
   and promptly be shifted into the dark state where none of your normal
   build commands work ...
-  *Auto-teleportation*: Rooms that automatically teleport those that
   enter them to another place (like a trap room, for example). You
   would be teleported away too.
-  *Mobiles*: If you add aggressive mobs, they might attack you, drawing
   you into combat. If they have AI they might even follow you around
   when building - or they might move away from you before you've had
   time to finish describing and equipping them!

The solution to all these is to plan ahead. Make sure that superusers
are never affected by whatever effects are in play. Add an on/off switch
to objects and make sure it's always set to *off* upon creation. It's
all doable, one just needs to keep it in mind.

Assorted notes
--------------

The fact that you build as 'yourself' can also be considered an
advantage however, should you ever decide to change the default command
to allow others than superusers to call the processor. Since normal
access-checks are still performed, a malevolent builder with access to
the processor should not be able to do all that much damage (this is the
main drawback of the `batch-code processor <BatchCodeProcessor.html>`_)

`GNU Emacs <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs>`_ users might find it
interesting to use emacs' *evennia mode*. This is an Emacs major mode
found in ``src/utils/evennia-mode.el``. It offers correct syntax
highlighting and indentation with ``<tab>`` when editing ``.ev`` files
in Emacs. See the header of that file for installation instructions.
