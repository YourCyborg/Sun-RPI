Evennia Licence FAQ
===================

Evennia is licensed under the very friendly BSD License. You can find
the license as ``LICENCE.txt`` in the Evennia root directory. You can
also read the full license file
`here <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/source/browse/LICENSE.txt>`_.

Q: When creating a game using Evennia, what does the licence permit me to do with it?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** It's your own game world to do with as you please! Keep it to
yourself or re-distribute it under any license of your choice - or sell
it and become filthy rich for all we care.

Q: I have modified Evennia itself, what does the license say about that?
------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** The License allows you to do whatever you want with your modified
Evennia, including re-distributing or selling it, as long as you include
our license and copyright info in the ``LICENSE.txt`` file along with
your distribution.

... Of course, if you add bug fixes or add some new snazzy features we
still *softly nudge* you to make those changes available upstream so
they could be added to the core Evennia package. The license don't
require you to do it, but that doesn't mean we can't still greatly
appreciate it if you do!

Q: Can I re-distribute the Evennia server package along with my custom game implementation?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A:** Sure. As long as the text in LICENSE.txt is included.
