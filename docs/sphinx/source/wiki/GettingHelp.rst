Getting Help
============

The best way to get help is via our `Google
Group <http://evennia.com>`_. Simply post a message with a clear
question and you are more than likely to receive a response. This way
issues can be tracked over time too.

If you want more direct discussions with developers and other users,
consider dropping into our IRC chat channel
`#evennia <http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=evennia>`_ on the
Freenode network. Please note however that you have to be patient if you
don't get any response immediately; we are all in very different time
zones and many have busy personal lifes. So you might have to lurk about
for a while - but if you are patient you'll get noticed eventually!
