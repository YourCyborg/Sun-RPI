   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Evennia's documentation!
===================================

`Evennia <http://www.evennia.com>`_ is a barebones Python
MUD/MUX/MU\* creation system and server. It is using modern technologies and offering
great freedom to design the multi-user online text game of your dreams. You
code your game using normal Python modules - can't get more flexible
than that! 

This Sphinx-based (reST) documentation is built from the `online wiki <http://code.google.com/p/evennia/wiki/Index?tm=6>`_ at regular
intervals.
