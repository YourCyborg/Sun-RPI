A human soldier~
A human soldier stands by the gate, watching the crowds.
~
Bearing a characteristic straight-backed stride known all to well to a
disciplined soldier, this male human bears very simple features.  His
hair is cut close to his scalp and scars are evident, obvious marks from 
the grueling training, and Urikite soldiers must go through.  He carries 
obsidian weapons and is clad in yellowish chitin armor.

A pudgy templar~
A pudgy templar in a yellow robe stands nearby, arms folded.
~
This sick-eyed templar is obviously in a natural state of obesity.
His pudgy upper body in a testament to a life of luxury and soft,
tanned skin shows that he spends no more then a few hours under the
fury of the crimson sun.  He bears a thick amount of fat below his
chin, gathering in folds at his throat and neck.  He peers about with
a cold glare, weighing his surroundings and the crowds with a lecherous
eye.

sword obsidian longsword~
an obsidian longsword~
An obsidian longsword lies here, bearing the emblem of Urik.~
This blade is crafted from obsidian, an element which holds a razor
sharp edge, but has the durability of glass.  It seems very simple and
spartan in nature, bearing no ornamentation or specific design.  The sword
itself is very long, reaching at least two arms in length, and it appears
sharp, but there is no telling when obsidian will shatter or simply break
in half.  The guardless handle is boiled leather wrapped tightly about the
bottom shaft of the obsidian, simple yet effective for a solid grip.
Burned into the obsidian is the walking man-Lion emblem of Urik.

The Lion of Urik Tavern - Main Room~
     This large tavern is built from the ground up of solid obsidian.  Rumor
has it that the Lion of Urik himself ordered the miners to hire fifty
half-giants so that they could get the block back to Urik.  The business
boasts an impressive amount of tables, and is at least fifty arms from
wall to wall.  The bar is on the eastern side of the establishment, solid
obsidian, growing from the floor itself, it hosts about twenty barstools
of which are also part of the floor.  Busy at all times of the day, and
accepting anyone in Urik, despite race, and despite the caste of nobles
and commoners, whom seem to mingle quite well in this atmosphere.
     The most impressive part of the tavern itself is the northern
wall which is host to a carving of the Lion King, each intricate detail
has been chiseled into the obsidian, and filled with a a yellow ceramic
tiling, leaving it a black mural of greatness.  A crude map is pinned on
the southern wall, showing the cities main roads and structures.
     Obsidian stairs rise from the tavern itself, traveling up,
westwards, a public quarter can be seen and behind the bar to the east is
the kitchen.

The Lion of Urik Tavern - Upstairs~
     All types of people travel to and from the several rooms available on
the upper floors quite frequently.  A noble with a whore on his arm will
pass by every so often, his personal guards trailing not so far behind.
Two massive half-giants, both with wide, stupid grins on their faces will
lumber past on rare occasion.  While expensive, they provide ample
privacy for most customers, even if they do come at a high price.
       The stairs travel back down to the tavern.

The Lion's Den~
     Upon entering, one will find this spacious room in much contrast to the
main room of the tavern.  Quiet and peaceful, it seems the more civilized
members of Urikite society spend their time in here, wanting to talk
without a vomitting dwarven mercenary nearby.  The room was decreed by a
by a templar to have it's own name, and the owner of the Lion of Urik Tavern
simply started calling it the Den.  An archway leads back to the Main
Room, eastwards.

Way of the Lion~
     Stretching from the eastern gate of Urik to the entrance gate of the
Palace itself.  Way of the Lion is one of the shortest main roads in the
city-state.  It is used for travel between the behemoth Obsidian Road
and the other two massive roads Way of Vengeance and Way of Patience.
All types of races can be seen meandering along the mortarted road;
long-legged elves dashing along the street, dusty humans with a range of
characteristics, half-giants lumbering along their way clumsily, and
perhaps the rare mul striding alongside his master.  Soldiers patrol
daily and nightly, and it is not uncommon to see a yellow-cloaked
templar or two with the small units that circumvent the city.
     To the north, the loud, unmistakable noises of a tavern belch forth
onto the street.

The Lion of Urik Tavern - Kitchen~
     The chaos and pace of the kitchens matches that of the Main Room, or
could be seen as, surpassing it.  Waiters and Waitresses yell out orders
to the cooks, and pick up arriving meals.  Steam rises up in certain
parts, and in others fires are blazing.  The heat, stench, yelling,
noise, and over all atmosphere is simply nerve-racking.  A spilt tray,
irate wenches, and food thieves are rampant, making the kitchens a place
where one might not want to spend a very long time in.
       The Main Room can be seen to the west.

     This intersection opens up broadly from Way of the Lion.  A mammoth
road known as Way of Vengeance cuts through north and south.
Southwards the road snakes past the buildings and warehouses of
merchant houses, towards Javed's Way.  Northwards it heads toward the
great Obsidian Road, which spans all the way from the eastern walls to
the western walls or Urik, and is the main route to and from the main
commoners quarter.

thick mekillot bone, agafari, and it seems stone was used in it's

turns into one of the two roads that branches from Urik.  Several
soldiers of the militaristic city be seen patroling around the
gate.  Upwards atop the high yellow walls of the city, one can spy
a few scouts, walking back and forth and watching over the environs of
the city-state.

Outside the Eastern Gate of Urik~
     The toweering gate rises up from the fields of Urik here, bearing
an opening to the city-state which looks like a safe haven from the wild.
Here and there, people can be seen entering the busy gate from all forms
of society; field slaves moving to and from the cities food supply with
wicker baskets, commoners heading out on their mundane business, hunters
of the great merchant houses heading out on mounts to find raw materials,
soldiers patroling moving out to patrol the fields or coming back,
covered in sweat to end their shift, nobility of all sorts looking
haughtily around the dingy atmosphere from their carriages with their
noses upturned, even templars can be seen on rare occasion leading a unit
of half-giants out on a mission.
       To the north and south, a dirt path moves around Urik.  To the
east, a road of ancient weathered stones snakes through the fields, to
the west the eastern gate opens to the city-state.

warehouses that are set north and south off of Way of the Lion.  The
road isn't nearly as busy as Way of the Lion, but has a steady flow of
traffic, which all seem to be commoners heading to or from the northern

     This southern path is a long, straight path through Urik heading
to Javed's Way.  Several warehouses, and buildings can be seen on this
path, which will eventually lead you to the southern commoners quarter;
mainly reserved for commoners higher up in the social order, such as
captains of the Urikite army, rich merchants, or perhaps a very skilled
blacksmith or two that are used for the nobility - whom also have their
quarter in the southern part of the city, nestled close to the palace of
Urik.

Way of the Lion~
     Stretching from the eastern gate of Urik to the entrance gate of the
Palace itself.  Way of the Lion is one of the shortest main roads in the
city-state.  It is used for travel between the behemoth Obsidian Road
and the other two massive roads Way of Vengeance and Way of Patience.
All types of races can be seen meandering along the mortarted road;
long-legged elves dashing along the street, dusty humans with a range of
characteristics, half-giants lumbering along their way clumsily, and
perhaps the rare mul striding alongside his master.  Soldiers patrol
daily and nightly, and it is not uncommon to see a yellow-cloaked
templar or two with the small units that circumvent the city.  The
massive palace can be seen rising over it's walled enclosure far to the west.
     The road continues east and west.

An Intersection - Way of the Lion and Way of Patience~
     Two roads intersect here, one traveling west and east, the other
moving north and south.  To the west the huge palace of Hamanu, Lion
of Urik cannot be missed; the crowds and amount of soldiers seem to
lessen the closer the palace gets, most likely because the palace is
open to the public, but many people prefer to worship their god in
in priviate, however a few visit the well-known sanctum where one can
bring donations or simply pray in silence.  
     Northwards and southwards, Way of Patience takes one away from
the crowds and palace.  The hospitable, main commoners quarter lies
northwards, the mudbrick buildings can be seen even from this distance,
pressed together tightly.  Southwards is the secondary quarter, where
the more wealthy commoners can afford to live, and down Javed's Way to
the west, the estates of the nobles quarter are seen, some rising as
high as the Palace, as if challenging it to a duel in the heavens.

     As Way of the Lion comes to a halting end the Palace Gate rears up with
the Lion-Kings face caught in a powerful snarl carved into the wood.  
Templars and soldiers move through the fire-blackened agafari gate
with purposeful strides, commoners pass by, a basket of fruit
or some other sort of gift for his god bundled under one arm.
Half-giants flank the gate, watching the sparse crowds with dull
gazes.  Pass the open gate a gravel path leads away from the obsidian walls
and to the Inner Sanctum, where a bountiful garden and prayer hall can
be seen from here.
     An agafari gate opens to the west, which will allow access to Hamanu's
Inner Sanctum.

partially on the east and west, however northwards on Obsidian Road
the main size of the quarter is finally realized, thousands of
mudbrick buildings lie off the obsidian ground of that road, bearing
well over half the population of the city-state.

     The flow of traffic on this road is far more busy then it's western
twin, Way of Patience.  Commoners pour north and south on the wide
path, some pushing and shoving, some ambling along quietly.  Here and
there a noble can be seen lounging in his litter; held up by mulish
servants that wear nothing but a loincloth, tossing a copper or two
down to the greedy hands of the poverty-stricken, apparently more to 
get them out of his way then to be charitable.  Here and there on the
road, the soldiers of the city march on, enforcing Hamanu's Code.

Way of Vengeance~
     The flow of traffic on this road is far more busy then it's western
twin, Way of Patience.  Commoners pour north and south on the wide
path, some pushing and shoving, some ambling along quietly.  Here and
there a noble can be seen lounging in his litter; held up by mulish
servants that wear nothing but a loincloth, tossing a copper or two
down to the greedy hands of the poverty-stricken, apparently more to 
get them out of his way then to be charitable.  Here and there on the
road, the soldiers of the city march on, enforcing Hamanu's Code.

Way of Vengeance~
     This road travels south to Javed's Way, and  bears light to no traffic 
at all. Mainly nobles walk along it's course, flanked by their guards.
However a few clean, silk-clad commoners can also be seen, moving with
a practiced stride of confidence.  A dirty beggar or two line the
sides of the road, hunched up against the large stone walls of the
warehouses, attempting to seek pity from any of the rich citizens or
patroling soldiers.  
     The road continues both north and south.

Javed's Way~
     This long road, named after an old Champion of Urik, moves in a east-west
direction, heading to and from the secondary commoner's quarter as well
as the noble's quarter.  Red brick compromises the structure of the
ground here and while the road is relatively new, the stones are
becoming weather-worn.  Their are cleared lots to the north and south
of the road, ready for new houses or buildings.  The noble's quarter
can be seen far westwards, the towering estates barely visible on the horizon.
     The road continues both east and west.

A Path to the South Gate~
This small dusty road will take one to and from the Southern Gate of
Urik.  It cuts through several high buildings, which are quite possibly
the houses of the middle-class commoners.  The stones of the road are
a yellowish brick, and are cracked from age, while to the north the
newer reddish bricks of Javed's Way can be seen.
     The path heads south and north.

Entrance to the Noble's Quarter~

blockades the noble's quarter and is flanked by an entire unit of
guard.  The estates and houses can be seen far above the gate, the
shingled roofs and shuttered windows a delightful image to the Urikite
nobility, but quite probably a contemptful one to the Urikite commoner.  
     A gate rises westwards, preventing all those without the proper 
authority to enter.

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.
     To the east and west the road continues, while southwards another
road constructed of old gray stone cuts off toward the center of
the city.

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort

Caravan Way~
     The dust accumulates thick on this road, as if attracted by some
unseen eddy.  Tracks of all sorts can be seen in the dust; wagon
wheels, huge argosies and their mekillots paw prints, various
humanoid boot prints - some as large as a half-giants.  The road moves
from Caravan Gate southwards to the merchant's quarter, it also serves
as an unloading point for some argosies who are so massive they will
not fit through any other road, save Obsidian.  Most wagons however
will unload off Obsidian Road and trek their wares southwards to the
warehouses.  The crowds here are mainly wandering merchants, trying to
sell wares, but the great Market of Urik is northeast of this road.

Caravan Way~
     The dust accumulates thick on this road, as if attracted by some
unseen eddy.  Tracks of all sorts can be seen in the dust; wagon
wheels, huge argosies and their mekillots paw prints, various
humanoid boot prints - some as large as a half-giants.  The road moves
from Caravan Gate southwards to the merchant's quarter, it also serves
as an unloading point for some argosies who are so massive they will
not fit through any other road, save Obsidian.  Most wagons however
will unload off Obsidian Road and trek their wares southwards to the
warehouses.  The crowds here are mainly wandering merchants, trying to
sell wares, but the great Market of Urik is northeast of this road.

Path to Southern Gate~
     This wide cobblestone path skirts off Javed's Way, moving south to the
a huge reinforced gate that is visible even from here.  Crowds, mainly
consisting of nobility move along this road, in small carriages pulled
by lavishly-painted kanks or carried along by several expensive muls.
Here and there a breeze stirs up, but catches nothing but bodies in
it's grasp.  The road looks swept immaculately clean, and every so
often a slave can be seen on the road with a straw broom, gathering
dust and sand into a bone dustpan.

Southern Gate~
     A reinforced mekillot-bone gate lifts high into the air here,
open at all times unless weather or war comes near Urik, which is a
rare thing.  The nobility use this road for easy access to the
southern fields of Urik, because it is so close to their quarter.
Some commoners can be seen using it as well, but they seem to be far
better off then the average citizen of Urik.
     Cobblestones trail off northwards down a path, while to the south
the immense Southern Gate lies in between the yellow walls of Urik.

here and there.  A soldier or two can be seen patroling out in the fields
to the east, which yield grain and and crops for Urik's food source,
which is one of the strongest in the entire known world.  To the west,

which is one of the strongest in the entire known world.  To the west,
the yellowish walls of the city-state rise up, stopping any challenger
from entering the great city without leave of the gate.

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.
     To the east and west the massive road continues, off to the northeast
of the road a larger crowd can be seen milling about.

     The road abruptly ends to the east, blocked by a high yellow
wall, while northwards a path of cobblestones leads to a crowded plaza.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a

       To the west, a large archway opens up to an establishment,
while the Marketplace continues in all other directions.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik rise to the north, stopping the
Market there, however to the west east and south it continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market place.  A ten-arm high wall looms to the east.

in every other direction the chaos continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible just to the north while
in every other direction the chaos continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible just to the north while
in every other direction the chaos continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the

the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible just to the north while
in every other direction the chaos continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and

     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.
