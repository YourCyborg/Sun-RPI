Along a Moat~
     Like a belt of liquid dirt, the expansive mud moat leads east and
west around the city which sits on the far side from here.  Countless
scores of mud-brick buildings vanish endlessly into the span across the
moat, lining the northern horizon with a dull red hue.  To the south, the
expanse of the mud flat continues indefinitely.
       To the east, a bridge leads northward over the moat and into
the city.

In the Air Above a Mud Flat~
     There is nothing here except empty air.  The ground looms
ominously below.  Very far to the north is an expansive city filled with
squat buildings, although it appears miniscule from this distance.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  Far to the north is the inner shore of
the moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  To the south
is the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  Far to the north-east is the inner shore
of the moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  To the
south is the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

In the Air, Very High Above a Mud Moat~
     There is nothing here except empty air.  A wide moat of mud looms
ominously below, to a large distance considering the current altitude.  To
the north is an expansive city that appears rather small in scale from
this height.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  To the north is the inner shore of the
moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  Far to the south
is the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  Far to the west is the inner shore of the
moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  To the east is
the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  Far to the west is the inner shore of the
moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  To the east is
the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  To the south is the inner shore of the
moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  Far to the north

In the Air, Very High Above a Mud Moat~
     There is nothing here except empty air.  A wide moat of mud looms
ominously below, and to a large distance considering the current
altitude.  To the south is an expansive city that appears rather small in
scale from this height.

Within the Mud Moat~
     In the middle of the moat, there is thick brown mud everywhere.
The smell of water-saturated soil lies heavy in the humid air, making it
somewhat difficult to breathe.  To the east is the inner shore of the
moat, with a number of squat buildings just beyond it.  Far to the west
is the outer edge, which borders the continuing mud flat.

Along a Moat~
     Like a belt of liquid dirt, the expansive mud moat leads east and
west around the city which sits on the far side from here.  Countless
scores of mud-brick buildings vanish endlessly into the span across the
moat, lining the northern horizon with a dull red hue.  To the south, the
expanse of the mud flat continues indefinitely.
     To the west, a bridge leads northward over the moat and into
the city.

Dry Mudflats~
     In every direction, flat, dry mud expands towards the horizon.
The dull-brown hue of the ground seems to suck light into it, creating a
matte brown blanket that is nearly glare-less.  The smell of wet soil is
faint here, and what there is of it comes and goes with the idle eddies
and currents of air which tousle this land from the south.
     In the near distance to the east, a stone road leads northward

Dry Mudflats~
     In every direction, flat, dry mud expands towards the horizon.
The dull-brown hue of the ground seems to suck light into it, creating a
matte brown blanket that is nearly glare-less.  The smell of wet soil is
faint here, and what there is of it comes and goes with the idle eddies
and currents of air which tousle this land from the south.
     Far to the north, a large city rises low to the ground and
just manages to split the horizon.

Along a Moat~
     Like a belt of liquid dirt, the expansive mud moat leads east and
north around the city which sits on the far side from here.  Countless
scores of mud-brick buildings vanish endlessly into the span across the
moat, lining the northern horizon with a dull red hue.  To the south and
west, the expanse of the mud flat continues indefinitely.

Dry Mudflats~
     In every direction, flat, dry mud expands towards the horizon.
The dull-brown hue of the ground seems to suck light into it, creating a
matte brown blanket that is nearly glare-less.  The smell of wet soil is
faint here, and what there is of it comes and goes with the idle eddies
and currents of air which tousle this land from the south.
