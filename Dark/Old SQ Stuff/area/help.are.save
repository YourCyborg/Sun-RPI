36 reset~
Usage: Reset <command> <number> <type> < v1 v2 v3 >

Reset commands are: append, delete or list.
Type is one of:  mobile, give, inventory, object, put or door


To add in a reset, the number defaults to 0.

Example: reset append 0 object 32 0 20

Let's break it apart.

Reset: Base command
append: add the reset
number: numbers the reset
type: it is an object reset
v1: object vnum
v2: set to 0
v3: room vnum that it pops.
---

To list the resets, type reset list 0.

Example: reset list 0

---

To reset an area, type reset area <number>

---

To delete a reset, list them first, and then delete it by its number, you
should get something like...

Example:


< 30  > reset list 0
Log Xione: reset list 0
1  O 43 43 32
2  M 1 1 2
3  M 5 2 3
4  O 43 43 32
5  M 5 2 3
6  O 32 0 20
7  O 32 0 20
8  M 30 0 30

You would then "reset delete 8" to remove reset 8.
The values listed go: Number, Type, obj/mob vnum, unknown, roomvnum.

0 Baazrag~
Broad and muscled, 9 arms tall from toe to crown, baazrag tend to hunch
when they stand (which is rare) over to a height of 5 feet, with a 
large hump in their backs that diminishes as they are dehydrated.
Baazrag typically use the knuckles of their hands as well as their
feet when they walk or run.
  Baazrag have been described as "600 stones of fur and muscle." 
Generally they only stand to their full height when they are angered.
Their skin is a mottled red and gray and a mop of dark hair runs from
their foreheads all the way down to the backs of their thighs, but their
faces and chests are scaled and hairless.  Their arms are disproportionatly
large for their bodies, and their hands doubly so.  With three fingersand
a thumb on each hand the baazrag has hands as large as a half-giant even
though they stand less then half their height.  Because of their powerful
legs muscles, they are often used to pull carts within the cities.

Baazrag_Society
~


0 Baazrag_Society~
A distant cousin to the Athasian sloth is a wild creature, often domesticated
for slave labor in the cities.  Although quite dull, the baazrag is sentient, 
and some can understand the common tongue, although they approximate it
poorly with their grunts, howls, and growls.  City baazrags understand the
common speech and can learn and understand other languages over time; however
they themselves cannot be understood, their throats and gullets make
it difficult for them to eununciate words in the common speech, and other
languages.
  It takes much concentration and study for non-baazrags to comprehend
the baazrag's garbled voice.  Nevertheless, some humanoids find the  
skill worthwhile, since baazrags can be faithful and useful companions.
Such people are known as "baazrag handlers" by the animal trade, and 
can always find good employment as overseers and trainers.
  In their wilderness packs, baazrags follow their druidic shaman    
with a great deal of deference, not understanding the shaman's
dealings with the elements and the spirits that in their beliefs
run the world.  City-bred baazrags remain very superstitious, and
believe almost anything that they are told about the supernatural.
The most awesome displays of supernatural power tend to win their
respect and submission.
  In the cities, baazrags tend toward a brutish neutrality.  Baazrags
raised in captivity tend to obey, and accept verbal abuse, but they
will lash out violently when physically hurt, regardless of the
consequences.  Only a fool flogs a baazrag.  Baazrags distinguish  
each other's gender by scent, not by appearance, and certainly
not by name, so their is no distinction between female and male
Baazrag names.  Baazrags fear magic, but do not hate it - they
have a fascination and curiosity with it, especially the showy kind.
They have been known to gape and cheer in admiration at a fireball
even when it is used against their allies.

0 Belgoi~
Belgoi are a race of savage humanoids that live in the most desolate of
places, since no other race will tolerate them nearby.  When seen from
a distance, a belgoi appears human, but their blue skin, clawed hands,
and webbed, three-toed feet soon give them away.  They have no teeth,
no visible ears, and their hair is always black and stringy.  Belgoi
seem to revel in destruction, and are considered to be second only to the
defilers in the damage they can do to the world around them.

Belgoi Society
  Belgoi form large nomadic tribes that move into an area, strip it of
all resources, and then move on.  These tribes send out raiding parties
that attack caravans and small villages, hoping to obtain food and loot.
They will eat anything but prefer the taste of the flesh of intelligent
races.  Belgoi speak their own language, and the common tongue.
~


0 Braxat~
Braxat are huge humanoids of mixed stock, mostly a combination of mammalian
and reptillian.  They have a thick shell that covers their back, and have
anywhere from three to five horny protrusions on the top of their head
that protect their head and are used for attacking their targets.
Braxat do walk upright, are able to speak with a clear, human voice, have
opposable thumbs, and are warm-blooded.  Braxat can be found in most parts
of Athas, usually hunting prey.  Mostly solitary creatures, sometimes
they pick a mate, and bear some young.  The young are usually hidden away
while the parents go in search of food for their offspring.  Braxat are
the ultimate terrors of the desert and are usually nocturnal.  Braxat
prefer intelligent prey, but will eat will caravan animals, or other
mounts on occasion, all but kank that is, it is said that kank meat seems to unsettle
their stomachs.  
  Braxat shells can be used to make excellent shields and armor,
usually crafted to create plate armor, because of the shell plating the
natural shell takes on the braxat's back.  Because of this, braxat are sometimes
hunted, but in most cases, the braxat is usually prepared for such
things, and the hunted ends of becoming the hunter.  There is nothing known
of the society of braxats.
~


0 Crodlu~
Crodlu are large, flightless combinations of a bird and a reptile.  Resembling
ostriches, they roam the wilderness in herds.  
  Crodlu have wicked claws at the end of their long forearms, and so
do their legs, which are naturally built for jumping great lengths.
Crodlu also have a yellowish-red, scaly hide, with other similar
colors along their sides and belly.  
  Crodlu have very poor eyesight, but make up for it with an excellent
sense of smell.  Crodlu have great endurance, almost better than a mul's 
and can run at high speeds for long periods of time.  Female crodlu lay
only one egg each year, when the chick hatches it is able run and fight
within minutes, having a great appetite.  When it comes to feeding,  crodlu
will eat anything, preferring to hunt live game when there is some
around, over eatting just vegetables.  Crodlu herds have been seen
with as many as 30 strong.  The herd leader is usually the largest, and
will have more of a reddish scaly hide.  Crodlu make great mounts, but
are hard to control and train as such most of the time unless they are caught
as chicks and are trained as mounts as they are being raised.

0 Dune Freak Anakore~
The anakore are a race of dim-witted humanoids with bony, wedge-like heads,
small ears pressed close to the sides of their heads, and sunken,
beady eyes, they have a dorsal ridge running along their spine that  
allows them to pick up vibrations travelling through the sand.  With it,
they can detect creatures moving along the surface.  
  Nearly all  anakore will attack their prey by burrowing underneath them, and
striking from beneath with their sharp claws and poisonous bite.  Once the
anakore's poison has had a chance to work, the dune freak will pull its
victim under the sand, and let it suffocate.

Anakore Society
  The anakore usually live within sandy heaps, like dunes, or the
alluvial fans at the mouths of canyons.  Normally they act in small packs  
with the most aggressive acting as leader.
~


0 Erdlu~
Erdlu are large, flightless birds, often used as livestock.  They can
weigh up to two hundred stones, and stand almost seven arms tall.  Erdlu  
are covered in thick, flexible, scale-like feathers, ranging in color from
dust-gray to soft reddish-brown.  An erdlu's legs are long and strong, propelling
it rapidly over the desert sands; the head, at the end of a long neck,
is rounded with a wicked, wedge-shaped beak.  The omnivorous erdlu is
a very common herd animal, with many uses.  Aside from its value as
a meat animal, the erdlu's beak, wing scales, and claws, all find
their way into various weapon heads and tools, and the egg of an erdlu
is an excellent sourcee of food and water.  Cooked, a single egg can provide
about three days' worth of food for a human.  Raw, the egg's liquid contents
can be substituted for about one gallon of water.

0 Gaj~
A gaj looks like a twisted cross between a spider, and a tortoise.
From it's huge bulbous head, grow three large, feather-like antennae,
six compound eyes, and a pair of powerful mandibles.  Its body is six
arms in diameter and covered by a scaly, rust-orange shell.  Six
four-joined legs, ending in webbed feet, sprout from beneath the
shell.
  Gaj are carnivores and require flesh to survive, but they also need to
consume the mental energy of other sentient creatures to survive,
because of this they are very rare.
~


0 Giants~
Giants are huge, lumbering, and savage creatures that are said to live
in the sandy wastes of Athas.  It is a well-known rumor around cities
that the largest concentration of giants inhabit the islands of the
Silt Sea, however this is just a rumor.  There are three major types
of giant: beasthead, desert, and plains.

0 Beasthead~
The smallest version of the giants of Athas, beasthead giants have
humanoid bodies with the head of an animal or monster.  Most stand
between twenty arms tall, and have very pale skin.  It is known that
Beastheads love to throw rocks at their victims, and when they are
out of 'ammunition' they sprint in for close combat.
  Not much is known on the society of these giants, and where they live
is speculation and only rumors  that they apparently live on islands
in the Sea of Silt.

0 Currency~
Don't know yet, here is what I have in mind.
Ceramics
Copper
Silver
Gold.
Kind of shitty, but ceramics are going to be what the common players use 
most.  Gold of course is the rarest, but will be abundant with some of
the most powerful merchant houses.  
100 ceramics = 1 copper
100 coppers = 1 silver
100 silver = 1 gold

Simple, yet effective.

0 Desert_Giant~
Standing twenty to thirty arms tall, desert giants resemble massive
humans.  Their features are exaggerated in some ways: may have huge
noses, mouths, brows, chins, or ears.  The skin of a desert giant is
dark, leathery and very thick, providing excellent protection against
both weapons and the elements.  Most wear a minimum of clothing, no
more then a loincloth and sandals.  The hair of desert giants is dark,
coarse, and very strong, they often grow it in braids which are
eventually cut and traded as rope.  The desert giant loves to throw
spears, or even rocks, before entering melee combat.  
 The society of desert giants is not well known.  But rumors tell that
they raise herbs of kanks, and erdlus on one of the more arid islands of the Sea
of Silt, and have limited trade with cities close by.

0 Plains_Giant~
Plains giants appear to be huge versions of elves.  Their twenty five
to thirty arms of height is mostly in their legs and they have
distinctly elven facial features.  Their skin is usually a dark red or
brown.  And rumors say that they have fair hair and light blue or gray
eyes.
 Plains giants society is more well-known then the other giants.  They
maintain more contact with other races then most giants.  They have
been known to act as mercenaries for villages, merchant houses, and city-states.
Rumor has it that they inhabit the less-rugged, brush-covered islands
of the Silt Sea.  They produce food by gathering vegetation and
herding kanks, and erdlus.

0 Measurement~
I have an idea of the measurement I am going to use, since Darksun
used the American feet, inches, etc, I am taking that as a base for
now and using creativity to try and make a working system for the mud.


Miles = ? Was thinking Mek but do not know...
1/2 Mile = ?
Feets  = Arms
Inches = Thumbs

Pounds  = Stones (simple and effective)
Gallons = ?
Pints   = ?
Teaspoons, etc = ?

Also, outside rooms will usually be estimated at 1/2 mile to a mile,
city rooms are about 30 feet up to 50 feet (varied upon room) 
Keep this in mind when building!  There are exceptions of course, but
ask me if you are not sure.

This is in the works, and ideas should be e-mailed to me, and would be
appreciated.

0 Gith~
Gith are a lanky race of reptillian humanoids that, when erect,
stand close to seven feet tall, but who spend most of their time bent-
over in a crouch that makes them appear to be only five feet tall.
Their greenish-gray skin is hairless, and their lidless eyes are solid
black with no visible iris or pupil.  Both their fingers and toes end
in sharp claws.  Their lower jaw juts out in a pronounced under-bite.
They have no teeth, but have sharp, bony ridges that they use to crush
and grind their food.  Their powerful legs allow them to make great
leaps, which they use to move about, walking in an awkward waddle only
when they cannot jump or when sneaking up on prey.  Most gith
encountered outside their homes are vicious warriors.  Gith combat
tactics usually involve ambushes.  They prefer to have a distinct
advantage in numbers, and so, attack in mass.  Their weapon of choice
is usually an obsidian spear, but will use any weapon they have access
to.  They disdain the use of ranged weapons, since they enjoy watching
the pain and fear of their opponents.

Gith_Society
~


0 Gith_Society~
Gith organize themselves into tribes, with the most powerful member as
the leader.  All authority comes from the chief, whom has the power of
life and death over any member in his tribe.  If the chief is killed,
the strongest members of the tribe will fight to the death in order to
determine who will be the new leader.  This trial-by-combat occurs
immediately, even if the gith tribe is currently in the middle of a
battle with another force.  Most gith tribes inhabit mountainous
regions, coming down only to raid the villages of other humanoids, or
to attack a passing caravan.  They are usually entertained by the
suffering of others and with the prospect of a good meal, they will
eat anything organic, and prefer meat.  Gith speak their own language,
which has no alphabet but can be expressed in elvish script.
~


0 Inix~
Inix are huge lizards, and are midway in size betwen a kank and a mekillot. 
Inix weigh roughly three thousand stones and have been known to grow up to
sixteen arms in length.  Inix make good mounts because of the amount
of weight they can carry for their size and weight, which is two times the
normal capacity.  In combat inix are fierce enemies, they can use
their tails, and they will eventually try to bite, but it has been
said they can swallow a halfling whole and will try to do so in
combat.
~


0 Jozhal~
Jozhal are small, lightly-built reptillian creatures which may be
distinctly related to crodlu.  They have long, slender legs, lanky
arms, ending in dextrous hands, and long, flexible, tails.  The neck
of a jozhal is long and flexible, ending in a narrow-muzzled head with
large eyes and needle-like teeth.  The skin is covered in many tiny
scales, which are only visible in close examination, and can change
color to match with or contrast against the creature's surroundings.
Jozhals have precise control over their skin's color, and sometimes
use it to create decorative patterns of color resembling tattoos.  
  Jozhals avoid combat if at all possible, fleeing or using their
chameleon-like skin to hide.  If forced into combat, a jozhal will
attempt to defend itself first psionically, or with a spell which they
have been known to use.  If they must, however, they will resort to
simple bite attacks.

Related help files:
Jozhal_Society
~


0 Jozhal_Society~
Jozhals are naturally shy and secretive creatures, and do not normally
learn the languages of other races.  The leader of a family will learn
the Common tongue, so that he or she may communicate with outsiders on
the rare occasion that interaction is necessary.  When around those
they do not know, especially other races, jozhals become much more
withdrawn and are unwilling to even speak to outsiders unless
necessary.  They will often travel days out of their way just to avoid
encountering non-jozhal, especially elves and humans who they consider
destructive.  If forced to interact with members of another race,
jozhals will attempt to make the experience as short as possible.
  Jozhals do not normally form permanent settlements.  Instead, they
travel in nomadic family groups, traveling between the fertile areas
of the Tablelands and Hinterlands, beyond the Ringing Mountains.
These families forage for roots, nuts, and small reptiles and
insects.  Jozhals always make use of every little bit of anything that
they find, to the point of extremes, practicing cannibalism and
fashioning bones of their dead into weapons and tools.  The only time
a jozhal family will permanently settle in one area is when a member
of that family becomes a Grove Master, and takes custody of those
lands.   It is also a well known fact that jozhals are deeply suspicious of magic. 
  Jozhal is a language composed of clicks, pops, and whistles.  Do to
its unusual nature, many who are not familiar with jozhal will not
even recognize it as a language.  The vast majority of jozhal do not
keep a written form of their language.  
~


0 Kank Domestic~
Many kanks roam wild across the the Tablelands, as well are herded.
These large, docile insects have black chitinous exoskeletons, and are
divided into three sections, head, thorax, and abdomen.
There are three known kank types in Athas, Brood Queen, Worker, and
Soldier.  Brood queens can weigh as much as five hundred stones, are
five arms tall and around nine arms in length.  Workers can weigh as
much as two hundred to three hundred stones, are three arms tall, and
six to seven arms in length.  Soldiers can weigh as much as four
hundred stones, are around four arms in height, and eight arms in
length.
  They can carry objects with their multi-jointed pincers, or use them
in combat.
  Soldier kanks are often used as caravan mounts, as they can travel
for a full day at top speed, while carrying a tremendous amount of
weight for their size.  They are also used as herd animals by elves
and others, since they can thrive in any type of environment.  Plus
they need little attention, as instinct drives them into organization.

0 Kank_Ecology~
Workers are the only ones that produce kank honey.  Kank honey is a
very sweet and fetches a high price.  It can sustain the food (but not
water) requirements for a medium-sized creature for days.
Kank exoskeleton can be used as armor, but it is very brittle and has
to be treated properly to toughen it up some.  Exoskeletons are
sometimes used for construction of chitin structures.
~


0 Kank_Society~
Kank organize themselves into hives.  Worker kank secrete large
globules of green honey, which is used to feed the young of the hive.  
  Brood queens lay the eggs, usually twenty to fifty at a time.  The
soldiers then fiercely defend the area until the eggs hatch.
  Kank choose an area for egg laying which is near an abundant amounts
  of vegetation for food.

  A brood queen will avoid combat at all costs, unless all her
soldiers and food producers are dead, and/or she is backed into a
corner.
  A worker only goes into combat when all the soldiers are dead and/or
  they are backed into a corner.  
  A soldier is the first line of defense for the hive.  It is a well
known fact in Athas that soldier bites are poisonous.
~


0 Mekillot~
Mekillots are mighty lizards that can weigh twelve thousand stones,
with huge mound-shaped bodies that can easily reach thirty arms long.
They are covered with a thick shell everywhere except for their sides
and bellies.
Mekillots are used as caravan beasts; a hitched pair can pull a full
argosy at a slow pace.  Mekillots are never truly tamed, however, for
the creatures have been known to go off the road and wander for days.
  They also like to make snacks of their handlers.  Most caravans using
these behemoths have a small team of psionicists to deal with the beasts.
  In a fight, mekillots attack with their tongues, or they trample
enemies underfoot.  A mekillot instinctively drops to the ground when
something is underneath it, causing instant death or extreme damage to
the victim.
~


0 Silk Wyrm~
Silk wyrms, are large, flying, snake-like beasts that can reach over
fifty arms in length, and have a hard chitinous shell that covers their
body.  The dangerous silk wyrms spin their paralyzed victims into a silk cocoon.
This silk casing is highly prized in most city-states because of it's
resistance to fire, and is mostly used in the manufacture of silk
clothing.
~


0 Tembo~
The tembo is a savage predator that resembles a large hairless
canine.  Its body is covered in loose folds of light, brown scaly
hide, and measures about four arms long.  All four feet have
razor-sharp claws, and large canines protrude from its upper jaw.  A
tembo will eat anything, but prefers the children of sentient races.
It is said that some very strong tembo have a psionic bite that can paralyze.

0 Ral Guthay~
The two twin moons, Ral and Guthay are the key to the calender of
Athas.  The merchants have a way of telling the month and days
easily while others such as commoners and slaves could care less.
Ral is the smaller, silver moon, propossed to be an unlucky sign if
one is born under it.  Guthay is the larger, golden moon, said to be
a very lucky ordeal if one is born under her light.

37 material~
The material command checks the properties of the material argument
given.  There are more than 100 existing materials currently, but most
of them aren't really needed for most areas.  (A lot of them are
potential spell components and gemstones.)

The most common materials used should probably  be:
bronze
leather
pine    (perhaps a different wood.)

Especially strong or valuable materials should not be used very often.
Obvious examples are diamond, gold, and steel.

Lots of types of semi-precious stones exist for making jewelry, so
use zircon instead of diamond etc. unless diamond is really necessary.
~


37 cload~
Cload creates a reset entry for an already existing mobile.
So if you have a mobile named guard in the room with you,
type:
     cload guard
and the guard will be added to the reset list.

If the mobile is already linked to a reset, it will create a duplicate
mobile and create a reset link to the new mobile.

Things are coming along.  Still waiting for the account code from Xione, he's
working hard though! Looking for more builders again, because right now it seems
that Parthenon and Thalladorn are the only two active Builders besides myself
and Flux is back from his brief vacation.  Anyway things are still coming along
slowly but it's looking good with Urik/Draj/Tyr connected and Silver Spring
connected as well, the world is coming together..

0 cast~
Syntax: cast <spell> <target>
note: This system is going to be re-done, re-hashed, and far more
advanced in the near future. 
-Delerak

The <target> is optional.  Many spells which need targets will use an
appropriate default target, especially during combat.

If the spell name is more than one word, then you must quote the spell name.
Example: cast 'cure critic' frag.  Quoting is optional for single-word spells.
You can abbreviate the spell name.

When you cast an offensive spell, the victim usually gets a saving throw.
The effect of the spell is reduced or eliminated if the victim makes the
saving throw successfully.

Spell proficiencies are given to you when you choose your character class.
How accurately you cast a spell improves through failure.  How powerful
and how much mana drain it takes of you improve through success.

It may be possible to gain new spellls from certain objects, teachers,
and through other methods...

remains bashed improve with use.
~

TELL sends a message to one awake player anywhere in the world.

REPLY sends a message to the last player who sent you a TELL.  REPLY will work

0 Athas~
The endless wastes...The burning sand...The crimson sun...This is the
world of Athas, the world of the Dark Sun campaign setting. Athas'
savage, primal landscape is the result of long centuries of ecological
and magical abuse. The world is dying. It breathes its last gasps as
water turns to silt, grasslands become sandy wastes and jungles decay
into stony barrens. Still, life finds a way to endure even in these 
hellish conditions. In fact, it thrives.

Athas is a place of contrasts. Bleak deserts exist beside verdant
belts, rocky badlands give way to thick forests, and scrub plains
surroud opulent oases. These contrasts go beyond envrionmental
conditions. Magic, for example, is relativly scarce and universally 
feared, while psionic powers are a common and accepted part of life.

Water is more precious than gold in this resource-depleted world, and 
metals of all sorts are likewise in short supply. Except for heat and
sun, blood and dust, few things can be found in abundance.

Children growing up beneath the crimson sun don't aspire to become
heroes. True heroes who champion causes or seek to make the world 
a better place are as rare as steel on Athas. Living to see the next
dawn is more important than defending a set of beliefs, so survival 
ultimately motivates all living creatures- not virtue or righteousness.

Today, Athas rushes toward its future. If the course of destruction is 
to be diverted, if Athas is to be restored, then more heroes must grab 
the reins of destiny and give Athas a new hope.

you're looking at them.

Add "peek" to the look command when looking, for example:
look guard peek
