The Training Hall Entrance~
This wide hallway heads north into the main training grounds, and south
into Ral Temple's main corridor.  This section of the temple also serves
as a gathering place for knights and templars about to leave on specific
tasks.  The ground is covered with thick agafari floor boards which, like
most of the temple, get used often.  The walls are dark grey stone, and
are barely less-scratched than the floor they sit upon.  There are a
number of wall hangings made from pulped agafari sawdust.  The paintings
on them are crude and colorless, but they portray the general
battle-hungry attitude of the people who occupy this hall.

A Large Mess-Hall~
This noisy hall is filled with long wooden tables, and houses scores of
noisy knights.  The floor, walls, and tables are all stained from
food-spillage, though it appears that some effort has been put to
cleaning them.  To the north end of the rectangular hall is a servery,
where the occupants of the hall can go and fetch their meals.  Behind the
servery is an equally noisy kitchen, from which floats strong odors of
cooking flesh.

A Room With A Spiraled Staircase~
This room leads either back down the obsidian-stepped staircase or west
into the second tier of the Ral Temple.  To the west peeks a white-tiled
hallway that is significantly more aesthetically pleasing than the one
below it.  Though this floor shows signs of wear, it is well maintained.
There are large obsidian pillars set into the walls at the four corners
that run from the top of the temple to the bottom floor that help support
the massive stone room.  They are etched with faint carvings of moons,
jaguars, and feathers, and are roughly themed around battle and conquest.

A White-Tiled Hallway - Ral Temple~
This hallway circles the second tier of the Ral Temple, and is less
congested than the one below it.  There are few templars here, and even
fewer knights.  There are, however, more clerks, officials, and
occasionally nobles strolling the halls intently.  The floor is tiled in
obsidian stones that have been painted white, while the grey walls
display expensive works of art and decoration, most of which is themed
around battle, carnage, and conquest.

Templar Apartments~
This wide hallway stretches to the west, and is lined with heavy wooden
doors on either side.  Each door is carved with the Two Moons of the Draj
king in silver and gold, as well as smaller symbols indicating the
current occupant of the apartment.  The floor is tiled with criss-crossed
hardwood planks that appear to have been sanded and buffed recently.
Between each pair of doors, a torch is attached to the wall, projecting
pockets of light down the corridor.  At the end, a window looks out and
barely pokes over the wall of Two Moon city and into the commons of Draj.
Directly below, the window shows the twenty foot gap between the side of
the Ral Temple and the outer Two Moons wall.

This large room is roughly shaped like a circle, and contains a large
table at the center surrounded by multiple chairs.  A candle chandelier
hangs by a chain from the ceiling, and casts a warm glow about the room.
There is a small fountain at the center of the table intended to supply
liquid to the occupants of the chairs during extended meetings.  The top
of the table displays a large carving of Athas' two moons, the smaller of
which is silver while the larger is dull yellow.  The surrounding wall is
painted a dull beige and to prevent distraction during intense
conversations and battles of wit, it contains no excessive ornamentation.

This expansive room is cleverly decorated to resemble a lush, desert

and wenches serving food to them.  Each table is covered with a dark blue
cloth and set with good quality obsidian dinnerware.  Various potted
plants of different sizes sit both in the corners, and along the walls.
there is a fountain in the middle of the hall, where a wench periodically
goes to fill a pitcher of water.

This small workshop is cluttered with lengths of leather, nails, tools,
wood, chitin plates, and chords of giant hair.  A small workbench sits in
the middle of the room and serves as more of an appraisal apparatus
rather than a real tool.  There is a door leading to a much larger
workroom to the back, though it appears to be off limits to the patrons
of this workshop.

An Entryway - Ral Temple~
This broad hallway is plainly designed, with no frills on the walls and
pillars that outline the area.  The ground is roughly scuffed from an
excessive amount of troops moving through here.  On the western wall,
there is a large plaque with a stylistic depiction of a jaguar ripping
its prey to shreds - the generic symbol for the army of Draj.  A faint
odor of sweat clings to the area, though it is barely noticeable.
	To the south, the hallway opens into a large room intended for
conferences.  To the north, the hallway continues deeper into the temple.

A Rectangular Conference Room~
This domed room serves as a meeting place for high-ranking members of
the Draji armed forces and their acquantainces.  The fairly spartan hall
is adorned with little, save for a two-moons plaque on the west wall,
which is painted grey.  A dark blue stripe, about a foot wide, has been
painted at the top of the wall to break the line where the wall meets the
ceiling, which is of the same color.  At the center of the room is a
large agafari table suitable for either large or small meetings.  A
multitude of identical wooden chairs line the table on both sides, with a
slightly larger one at the head of the table.

The Ral Temple Entrance~
This immense building rises high to the west, though its size is dwarfed
by the Great Pyramid to the east.  Its stone walls are accompanied by
massive obsidian pillars that support the heavy stone roof.  Many knights
and templars walk in and out of this massive building, and occasionally
the odd clerk or army servant.  A unit of armed Jaguar Knights stand
guard at the entrance, their weapons drawn and their eyes intently
scanning the road and walls before them.  Above the archway entrance,
there is an intricate obsidian carving of the two moons of the God-King,
with a night-black jaguar leaping overtop.  The jaguar's eyes are set
with large chunks of jade, though they appear quite small from this
distance.  The teple wraps around to the north and south.

The Corner of Jaguar Plaza~
This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.

The Meeting of Ral Way and Wall Road~
This long road runs between the Ral Temple to the west and
the massive Great Pyramid to the east.  Far to the north, this road leads
into Jaguar Plaza, the location where Draji citizens go to watch
the God-King's ritual sacrifices.  Even further north, you can barely see
the tip of the Place of Gladiatorial Combat, the arena where the God-king and
his templars pit powerful slave gladiators against one another for the
amusement of the Draji citizens.
     To the east spans Wall Road, which runs just south of the Great
Pyramid.  It is bordered on the south by a twenty-foot-high obsidian wall
that protects Two Moons from invaders.  To the west is a building that
holds the God-Kings royal menagerie.

The Corner of Jaguar Plaza~
This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.
	A large obelisk with an obsidian jaguar perched on top stretches
upwards into the sky.

A Circular Training Grounds~
Empty description.  This large training ground sits below a huge domed
ceiling.  There is easily enough room for several hundred hundred troops,
and the area looks like it has been used by that many.  The various
sparring circles are scratched, chipped, scuffed, and generally abused
despite their sturdy construction.  In one of the corners, there are a
number of benches set beside a large pile of obsidian weights.  Against
another part of the wall, there is a group of wooden sparring dummies set
up for troops who lack sparring partners.  Overall, this area is sweaty,
bloody, and well-used.
