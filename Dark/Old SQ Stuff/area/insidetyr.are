Alley~
     The stench here in the alley is sickening.  A variety of plant
and animal matter -- some of it already digested, sits rotting here in
various states of decomposition.  A few puddles of scum have something
recognizable floating in their center.  Every few foot steps one risks
stepping into something soft, which usually isn't worth looking at any
further.  The bricks in the walls of buildings are smooth to the touch.
Some of them are chipped, and fractures in the masonry can run almost the
length of a building.  Mud has been used to patch some of the smaller
holes.  Every dozen footfalls or so one must be careful to avoid stubbing
one's toe on a loose brick that has been left on the ground.  It's fairly
common to find a few people squatting in this particular alley.  They
could never be mistaken for a lord or a prince after taking one glance at
their decrepit rainment.  These persons are homeless, and many of them
beg to make a living.  Alleys offer them some protection from sandstorms,
and serve to assuage the scrutiny they suffer from authority figures.

efficient way to sterilize water and heat food at the same time.  Cooking
fuel is scarce in Tyr, forcing economy when preparing food.

folk to gather to exchange a piece of gossip.  When the weather is not so
bad, one can spot a peasant doing some mending, or a bit of cleaning.

Inside an Alley~
     This alley is wide enough to navigate a carriage through,
provided that the driver is going slow.  Large piles of sand accumulate,
probably swept here off of the streets by slaves.  Not much attention has
been paid to beautifying this space.  As with most alleys in Tyr, it
serves mostly as access to the rear entrances and service entrances of
the buildings here.  The sound of children screaming drifts through the
alleys here.  Much of Tyr is a young population, with the majority being
well under thirty-five years in age.  Gazing about the alley, it is not
hard to see why this might be the case.  A variety of factors, mostly
related to health in one way or another, prevent most folk from reaching
a venerable age.  The stench here in the alley is sickening.  A variety
of plant and animal matter -- some of it already digested, sits rotting
here in various states of decomposition.  A few puddles of scum have

something recognizable floating in their center.  Every few foot steps
one risks stepping into something soft, which usually isn't worth looking

length of a building.  Mud has been used to patch some of the smaller
holes.  Every dozen footfalls or so one must be careful to avoid stubbing
one's toe on a loose brick that has been left on the ground.

common to find a few people squatting in this particular alley.  They
could never be mistaken for a lord or a prince after taking one glance at
their decrepit rainment.  These persons are homeless, and many of them
beg to make a living.  Alleys offer them some protection from sandstorms,
and serve to assuage the scrutiny they suffer from authority figures.

provided that the driver is going slow.  Large piles of sand accumulate,
probably swept here off of the streets by slaves.  Not much attention has
been paid to beautifying this space.  As with most alleys in Tyr, it
serves mostly as access to the rear entrances and service entrances of
the buildings here.  The sound of children screaming drifts through the

Inside an Alley~
     As one walks through the allies here, one is sometimes met with
the smell of food wafting from a nearby kitchen.  Tyrian cooking favors
stews, as this is arguably most efficient way to sterilize water and heat
food at the same time.  Cooking fuel is scarce in Tyr, forcing economy
when preparing food.  For someone strolling through this alley, they
would be exposed to a snapshot of Tyrian life.  The back lot of dwelling
flats or a craft hall is a popular space for folk to gather to exchange a
piece of gossip.  When the weather is not so bad, one can spot a peasant
doing some mending, or a bit of cleaning.  The ground in this alley is
paved only with sand, and that apparently deposited here by the wind.  The
walls of nearby buildings extend up on both sides for one or two stories.
The alley is approximately half of a mekillot-length long.  The bricks
that make up the surrounding walls are constructed of adobe.

     The buildings that line this alley have similar construction.
Adobe brick is the most common building material.  Bone is used to make
joists.  A few pieces of wood are used here and there as support
material.  Windows are few, due to the need to keep thieves, sandstorms
and scavengers out.  The ground in the alley is not paved with bricks or
stone.  Rather, it is made of packed dirt.  This is not as bad to walk or
ride on as one might suspect, since rainfall happens so seldom in the
Tablelands.  In some alleyways, one finds citizens engaging in behaviors
that they would be unwilling to attempt in the light of day.  For
example, a few blocks ahead one can make out the distant form of a noble,
garbed in silk, with their skirt around their ankles, as they engage in
intercourse with a prostitute.  On a corner intersection of two allies, a
couple of children offer to sell any passerby various articles of
contraband that they promise to steal from their older brother.  Behind a
couple of buildings, one can here the sounds of a pair of foreigners
getting into a heated argument.  Their arguments break into curses, which
are accompanied by the sound of fists pounding flesh.

often encounter the sorts of buildings that do not share such prominence
in allies.  Allies offer access to crawl spaces, storage sheds, stables,
outhouses and other structures that do not need to open directly onto the
road.  The buildings that line this alley have similar construction.
Adobe brick is the most common building material.  Bone is used to make
joists.  A few pieces of wood are used here and there as support
material.  Windows are few, due to the need to keep thieves, sandstorms
and scavengers out.

Tablelands.  In some alleyways, one finds citizens engaging in behaviors
that they would be unwilling to attempt in the light of day.  For

garbed in silk, with their skirt around their ankles, as they engage in
intercourse with a prostitute.  On a corner intersection of two allies, a
couple of children offer to sell any passerby various articles of
contraband that they promise to steal from their older brother.  Behind a
couple of buildings, one can here the sounds of a pair of foreigners
getting into a heated argument.  Their arguments break into curses, which
are accompanied by the sound of fists pounding flesh.

might notice a pair of children playing near the edge of a roof.  They
giggle and laugh, threatening to throw bricks at passersby, but of course

trash, what is unusual is the variety of completely useless junk that has
collected here.  Amid broken tools, one can spot chunks of rope, flecks
of old paint, broken imported pottery, shreds of silk, a handful of dingy
feathers, and even pieces of human bones.

Voices of people arguing drift out of one of the buildings here.  Insect
mating calls throb and pulse into the dry air.  The rocks that became
weathered down into the sand that has piled up around Tyr has a higher
concentration of isotheosilicates than most of the rest of the table
lands.  Also, the particle size is somewhat larger, decreasing it's
ability to sensitize the olfactory nerve ends in the lining of an
Athasians nose.  This gives a faint chalklike smell to the land.

     Trash has piled up in this alley.  Although it's not unusual to
find an alleyway littered with trash, what is unusual is the variety of
completely useless junk that has collected here.  Amid broken tools, one
can spot chunks of rope, flecks of old paint, broken imported pottery,
shreds of silk, a handful of dingy feathers, and even pieces of human
bones.  The sound of marching can be heard as a patrol of soldiers moves
by on a nearby street.  The cries of children ring off of nearby walls.
Voices of people arguing drift out of one of the buildings here.  Insect
mating calls throb and pulse into the dry air.  The rocks that became
weathered down into the sand that has piled up around Tyr has a higher
concentration of isotheosilicates than most of the rest of the table
lands.  Also, the particle size is somewhat larger, decreasing it's
ability to sensitize the olfactory nerve ends in the lining of an
Athasians nose.  This gives a faint chalklike smell to the land.

     The sky is partially eclipsed as one walks between a pair of
taller tenements.  Overhead, one might notice a pair of children playing
near the edge of a roof.  They giggle and laugh, threatening to throw
bricks at passersby, but of course they never do.  Trash has piled up in
this alley.  Although it's not unusual to find an alleyway littered with

The ground here gives clues to the foundation of an older building.  In
fact much of Tyr is like this, built upon the ruins of older structure.
This attributes to the fact that Tyr is quite an old city, and space is
indeed limited.  What was once an avenue may now be an alley, and what
was once an alley may now have a building.

the air as someone in a nearby structure prepares a meal with the honey

Inside an Alley~
     This alley is completely covered in graffiti.  Someone has taken
paint, and has painted various depictions of the Sorcerer King Kallak.
His Majesty appears performing sexual acts with groups of elves, and also
with kanks.  The art style is crude, and shows little degree of skill.
The ground here gives clues to the foundation of an older building.  In
fact much of Tyr is like this, built upon the ruins of older structure.
This attributes to the fact that Tyr is quite an old city, and space is
indeed limited.  What was once an avenue may now be an alley, and what
was once an alley may now have a building.  The smell of kank honey fills
the air as someone in a nearby structure prepares a meal with the honey
as seasoning.  The scent doesn't carry far because the air is so dray
that it seems to swallow up the vapors.  Even early in the morning, it is
unusual to find more than a few drops of dew.

     The rocks that became weathered down into the sand that has piled
up around Tyr has a higher concentration of isotheosilicates than most of
the rest of the table lands.  Also, the particle size is somewhat larger,
decreasing it's ability to sensitize the olfactory nerve ends in the
lining of an Athasians nose.  This gives a faint chalklike smell to the
land.  This alley is completely covered in graffiti.  Someone has taken

seems to have attracted a larger amount of sand here than nearby allies.
Fortunately, the city walls protect most of Tyr from the worst
sandstorms.  This is one reason that the city-state attracts such a large
proportion of the Tableland's population.  The air and the feel of the
city is less gritty on the skin than the open desert.

somewhat true that derelicts favor settling in the allies to slumping
openly on the streets.  It is probably less disturbing to them to have
fewer people stomping by as they are trying to rest.  For the most part,
these persons sit about drunk and don't disturb anyone, but not all of
them are content to leave others alone.  This alley occupies the site of
an ancient plaza.  Most of the tiles that once lined the plaza are gone,
however a few stubborn ones remain.  A couple of well-chipped chunks of
stone mark where the bases for a monument might have stood.

     This alley seems to have attracted a larger amount of sand here
than nearby allies.  Fortunately, the city walls protect most of Tyr from
the worst sandstorms.  This is one reason that the city-state attracts
such a large proportion of the Tableland's population.  The air and the
feel of the city is less gritty on the skin than the open desert.  It is

     The ground here gives clues to the foundation of an older
building.  In fact much of Tyr is like this, built upon the ruins of
older structure.  This attributes to the fact that Tyr is quite an old
city, and space is indeed limited.  What was once an avenue may now be an
alley, and what was once an alley may now have a building.  The smell of
kank honey fills the air as someone in a nearby structure prepares a meal
with the honey as seasoning.  The scent doesn't carry far because the air
is so dray that it seems to swallow up the vapors.  Even early in the
morning, it is unusual to find more than a few drops of dew.  This alley
seems to have attracted a larger amount of sand here than nearby allies.

these allies.  Certainly, it may be interesting to spy the aft side of he
buildings if one has already seen them from the front, especially the
contrast between the more presentable facades and the back.  Also,
occasionally popping through allies can be the best way to find shortcuts
through the city.  The shortest wall of the nearest building is comprised
of about thirty-seven vertically stacked rows of bricks, laid in an
overlapping pattern.  The dust that covers the ground wouldn't get caught
in a two hundred-grade sieve.  The distance between the walls of this
alley are about an eight of a mekillot length.  Air hangs in a throbbing
haze.  Sunlight is blinding outside of the shade during the brighter
days.  Insect mating calls are thick in the night.  Homeless persons
sprawl out on a pile of hay they have gathered.  The smell of refuse is
overpowering.

the shade of the buildings is too much for plant life to pass up.  Mostly
coarse weeds survive here, by virtue of the fact that no human or elf
knows of a use for them.  Some of them exhibit inedible seed pods.  A
handful of tiny arachnids file together in a line near the base of one of
the buildings here.  Further down their rank, one can spot the tiny
bug-hill that is their home, a small hole near it's tip marking the
entrance.  These critters are social animals, scavengers working together
for survival.  This alley sees lots of use as a shortcut for people
making their way between the districts of Tyr.  Except for the
close-pressing walls of the buildings, there isn't so much to distinguish
it from a street.  A few persons here gawk at those around them, but many
keep their eyes to themselves.  The streets here are visible from the
alley.  During the busier hours near dawn or dusk, traffic there is
heavy, by foot, carriage, cart and mount.  The sand beneath one's boots
is dry, except where a pile of refuse has been dumped recently.  Lines of
footprints stretch through this alley.

remains standing here.  It could scarcely be considered enough for
shelter from the wind.  Crumbling walls in other parts of Tyr get used by
poor families to construct lean-to shelters.  For some reason, this one
has been left alone.

for survival.  This alley sees lots of use as a shortcut for people
making their way between the districts of Tyr.  Except for the
close-pressing walls of the buildings, there isn't so much to distinguish
it from a street.  A few persons here gawk at those around them, but many

Inside an Alley~
     The streets here are visible from the alley.  During the busier
hours near dawn or dusk, traffic there is heavy, by foot, carriage, cart
and mount.  The sand beneath one's boots is dry, except where a pile of
refuse has been dumped recently.  Lines of footprints stretch through
this alley.  One wall of a ruined building remains standing here.  It
could scarcely be considered enough for shelter from the wind.  Crumbling
walls in other parts of Tyr get used by poor families to construct
lean-to shelters.  For some reason, this one has been left alone.  The
ground here is covered in sand.  Aggregated clumps of dirt clod up here
and there, leaving the frustrating impression that the ground is almost
but not quite arable.  If it were, some enterprising person would no
doubt cart it away to the fields to the north.  The sky over Tyr is a
dull orange, due to the lack of any oceanic light reflected back off of

Broken splinters of lizard bone and broken bits of pottery mark the

been swept in the past two years.  This alley terminates in a dead-end.
Someone has taken the trouble to brick up the walkway.  If one wishes to
continue walking, there seems no recourse but to attempt either to scale
the wall, or to return whence on has came.  Since the buildings here have
no fire escapes or drain pipes, climbing the walls of one can present no

back off of the atmosphere onto the ground here.  It shimmers during the
hottest parts of the day near high sun.  It throbs with the heat, not
venting well to the upper atmosphere.  This alley is littered with trash.
Broken splinters of lizard bone and broken bits of pottery mark the
remains of a meal.  Tattered pieces of vellum are rolled up on in a pile,
the writing therein indecipherable.  It's unlikely that this alley has
been swept in the past two years.  This alley terminates in a dead-end.
Someone has taken the trouble to brick up the walkway.  If one wishes to
continue walking, there seems no recourse but to attempt either to scale
the wall, or to return whence on has came.  Since the buildings here have
no fire escapes or drain pipes, climbing the walls of one can present no
easy task.

Inside an Alley~
     The ground here is covered in sand.  Aggregated clumps of dirt
clod up here and there, leaving the frustrating impression that the
ground is almost but not quite arable.  If it were, some enterprising

Reception Chamber~
     This reception chamber is made from stone blocks.  The ceiling is
vaulted.  Hallways lead off in three directions.  Sophisticated shafts
near the ceiling allow copious amounts of light into the room.  From
this, several potted plants are able to eke out an existence, presumably
well-tended by slaves.  Presumably, they also work to clean the floor of
any sand tracked in on people's boots.

     A foyer comprises the entrance to this villa.  Every element of
this foyer has been painstakingly chosen by trained slaves to make a good
impression on callers.  This is the first spot that a visitor sees.  To
the north an archway leads into a lounge.  To the south a doorway leads
to a bedroom.  Through a curtain of beads, a garden is visible to the
west.  A winding corridor branches to the east, leading further into the

Spout~
     This small space is where grain pours out of the silo when slaves
need to tap into the city's supply.  The chute is made of smaller bricks
that fit together more tightly, and the door is made of bone that slides
on a simple bone gear.  A small person can crouch here, but even a fat
dwarf would have problems curling up here for long because of the

Workshop~
     Anyone who watches the workers come and go from this shed might

worktables occupy part of this space.  Also, other necessities such as
sawhorses, barrels, work-sand and the like have been accrued so that
workers will have them on hand.  An empty tool rack is affixed to one
wall.  The ground is littered with shavings of bone, wood, and chitin.

Common Room~
     By contemporary standards, this room would be considered neither
comfortable, clean nor stylish.  By Tyrian standards, the place is not
half bad.  A few stone chairs are set about.  There are few cracks in the
adobe brick walls, and these have been patched.  The sand that layers the
floor is mostly clean.  Two stone tables are available.  One wall has a
rack on it.  The place smells of cooking herbs.

Brick Storage Room~
     Judging by its proximity to the Ziggurat, this storage room is
probably used to store adobe bricks until they are needed.  A few bricks
can usually be found here, of various sizes and hues.  Some bricks even
have curious shapes, like in the case of the curved bricks that are used
in round masonry, or the scallop bricks that are used for gardens.  This
room tends to accumulate a good amount of brick dust.

Sales Tent~
     The sand in here has the particular aspect of sand that has had
people living on it for a while.  Nothing else produces this quality in
sand.  Anyone who has lived long in the Tablelands might well be familiar
with it.  A number of smells strike the senses inside this tent.  Perhaps
foremost of them is the scent of leather.  A number of sounds reach the
inside of this tent.  Perhaps the strongest of them is the noise made by
children in their games, their struggles and their dramas.  This reflects
the predominantly young character of the crowd outside.  The
conversations of older persons do occasionally drift in, as though coming
from a distance.  Every now and then a round of deep-toned laughter is
audible, perhaps from a dwarf or a giant.  The walls of this tent are
made of a coarse canvas.  The canvas itself is likely linen.  Upon
further inspection of this material, one might note that the weave is
broad and the flax is likely of a low quality.  Doubtlessly, no great
expense was made in the preparation of this tent.

Workshop~
     Next to a couple of racks are a few work tables.  The table
surfaces themselves are chitin segments overlaid with a thin finish of
strong shale to provide a level work area.  Bits of cording, pins rivets
and fasteners are strewn across the surface of the table.  Marks where
hand-tools have been bolted to the table are visible if one looks closely
at the surface.  The walls are made of adobe bricks.  The bricks used to
make the walls have been laid in patches, presumably where extra
materials had been recycled from a variety of different jobs.  Most folks
might not pay this much mind, unless they are the sort of person who is
obsessed with details.  The ground here is covered mostly in sand, but a
few small and unobtrusive pieces of crumbly rocks, more properly termed
pebbles, are in evidence.  Most of the sand is a low-chroma orange color,
almost peach.  The sand has been smoothed and packed down enough that's
it's easy to walk or stand in.

sparse items of furniture are not well arranged for the space.  A few
rags are draped about the room - one from a table, one from a nail, and
some others are strewn across the floor.  The joint could use some
straightening up.

Spacious Tent~
     A number of sounds reach the inside of this tent.  Perhaps the
strongest of them is the noise made by children in their games, their
struggles and their dramas.  This reflects the predominantly young
character of the crowd outside.  The conversations of older persons do
occasionally drift in, as though coming from a distance.  Every now and
then a round of deep-toned laughter is audible, perhaps from a dwarf or a
giant.  The walls of this tent are made of a coarse canvas.  The canvas
itself is likely linen.  Upon further inspection of this material, one
might note that the weave is broad and the flax is likely of a low
quality.  Doubtlessly, no great expense was made in the preparation of
this tent.  Signs abound that someone or someones is living here.  For
example, a half-bale's worth of straw is spread out in one corner,
presumably used as bedding.  Curiously, there doesn't seem to be a
blanket nearby for use with the straw pallet.  A few loose bricks are
stacked neatly near the far end of the pallet.

Hideaway~
     This small structure was presumably built by children, a beggar,
or other desperate persons.  Half of an old barrel, most of a disused
crate, and several lengths of chitin have been made 
into a small shelter.
No doubt this shelter would be useful to get out of a sandstorm or avoid
the worst sun during the afternoon.  Fleas and other vermin have made
this hideaway their home as well.

Throne Room~
     A wooden throne occupies the center of this spacious room.  It is
carved from a dense, heavy wood.  Behind it a trellis with a fan service
allows a slave to unobtrusively fan anyone sitting in the throne.
Although light shafts keep the throne well lit, the edges of the room are
generally lined with shadows.  The room has good acoustics and seemingly
magnifies sound.

this space as both a work area and a storage space.  Most of the crates

is lined with shackles, and has more than a few old blood stains,
suggesting that this chamber is not the happiest place to spend one's

near the ceiling allow copious amounts of light into the room.  From
this, several potted plants are able to eke out an existence, presumably
well-tended by slaves.  Presumably, they also work to clean the floor of
any sand tracked in on people's boots.

Throne Room~
     A wooden throne occupies the center of this spacious room.  It is
carved from a dense, heavy wood.  Behind it a trellis with a fan service
allows a slave to unobtrusively fan anyone sitting in the throne.
Although light shafts keep the throne well lit, the edges of the room are
generally lined with shadows.  The room has good acoustics and seemingly
magnifies sound.

Inner Chamber~
     This is the inner chamber of the office, which is seemingly in
rougher shape than the rest of the building.  Presumably someone uses
this space as both a work area and a storage space.  Most of the crates
here are empty.  A stone work table rests against one wall.  Another wall
is lined with shackles, and has more than a few old blood stains,
suggesting that this chamber is not the happiest place to spend one's
time.

Records Office~
     This office is lined with crates, many of which are filled with
clay tablets and vellum parchments.  A few stone scribes' benches occupy
the center of the room.  Wall scones serve as receptacles for torches.
The air smells strongly of vellum.  The corners of this room are usually
covered in cob webs.  These are thicker above the level where a slave
could easily clean.

Reception Chamber~
     This reception chamber is made from stone blocks.  The ceiling is
vaulted.  Hallways lead off in three directions.  Sophisticated shafts
near the ceiling allow copious amounts of light into the room.  From
this, several potted plants are able to eke out an existence, presumably
well-tended by slaves.  Presumably, they also work to clean the floor of
any sand tracked in on people's boots.

straw pallets provide bedding here.  A few piles of the sort of worthless
personal effects that would be important to a slave is near most of the
pallets.  It would not be unusual to see a slave or two here, either
working or sleeping.  Otherwise, they might slink into or out of here
from the rest of the house on any number of tasks.

     An elaborate system of fans has been set up in this lounge.
Slaves can sit unobtrusively in an alcove, pulling a string to keep any
loungers cooled.  Luxurious looking padded couches are central to the
room.  A few artfully chizeled stones can serve as base receptacles for a
hookah service, when they are in use.  The trim near the cieling is
carved from a dark-grained imported wood, which is truly exotic to see.
It is set with geometric shapes to make it visually attractive.

Slave's Quarters~
     A small ventilated clay-brick oven dominates one corner of the
room.  A large stone table provides work-surface for the slaves of this
villa.  They sleep on the other end of the large room.  A collection of
straw pallets provide bedding here.  A few piles of the sort of worthless
personal effects that would be important to a slave is near most of the
pallets.  It would not be unusual to see a slave or two here, either
working or sleeping.  Otherwise, they might slink into or out of here
from the rest of the house on any number of tasks.

A Luxurious Lounge~
     An elaborate system of fans has been set up in this lounge.
Slaves can sit unobtrusively in an alcove, pulling a string to keep any
loungers cooled.  Luxurious looking padded couches are central to the
room.  A few artfully chizeled stones can serve as base receptacles for a
hookah service, when they are in use.  The trim near the cieling is
carved from a dark-grained imported wood, which is truly exotic to see.
It is set with geometric shapes to make it visually attractive.

Master Bedroom~
     This bedroom is way too large for one person.  The planks on the
floor are crafted of immaculately polished wood -- essentially a king's
ransom in the city of Tyr.  The cieling is vaulted.  Leather fans
installed near the cieling are attached to long cords, which can be
gently pulled by slaves who work outside the room to keep their master
cool while he sleeps

A Verdant Garden~
     This garden is ringed by a series of stone arches, which decorate
the high-quality stone walls.  A collection of plants grow here, about
half of which are not native to the Table lands.  A brick patio covers
part of the ground.  The rest of the ground is covered by precious top
soil.  A considerable amount of water must be added daily to maintain the
verdancy of this garden.

Common Area~
     This common area is lit by a single light shaft from the top near
the roof.  The roof itself is thatched with straw.  The ground is
comprised of packed clay.  The walls are made of adobe bricks.
Occasionally, one might spot a pair of children here.  There isn't much
to this room.  Mainly it shelters the area out front of these row houses
from the elements.  Three of them have entry ways behind doors that are
accessible from this room.

Rowhouse Apartment~
     This room has a high ceiling.  A few long stone beams add support
to the walls and ceiling, and assure the occupant of the structural
integrity of the construction.  Bone trim has been added near the
corners, and as a baseboard.  Chitin floor tiles are set into the ground,
providing a slightly iridescent surface upon which to tread.  No patches
are visible in the walls, implying that they are relatively new or have
had very neat repairs.  One can tell from looking around the interior of
the room that it is usually kept reasonably clean.  Vents help to cool
the room and provide airflow.  A couple of scones are on the walls for
torches.  One brick-lined fire pit is near the center of the floor.  The
room carries the scent of wood smoke.  The walls are constructed of adobe
brick.

integrity of the construction.  Bone trim has been added near the
corners, and as a baseboard.  Chitin floor tiles are set into the ground,
providing a slightly iridescent surface upon which to tread.  No patches
are visible in the walls, implying that they are relatively new or have
had very neat repairs.  One can tell from looking around the interior of
the room that it is usually kept reasonably clean.  Vents help to cool
the room and provide airflow.  A couple of scones are on the walls for
torches.  One brick-lined fire pit is near the center of the floor.  The
room carries the scent of wood smoke.  The walls are constructed of adobe
brick.

Common Area~
     This common area is lit by a single light shaft from the top near
the roof.  The roof itself is thatched with straw.  The ground is
comprised of packed clay.  The walls are made of adobe bricks.
Occasionally, one might spot a pair of children here.  There isn't much
to this room.  Mainly it shelters the area out front of these row houses
from the elements.  Three of them have entry ways behind doors that are
accessible from this room.

Scribing Room~
     This room is dominated by a large wooden reception table.  The
table is ringed by a number of chairs, and carved from a stained, dark
wood.  It looks like the sort of place where a group of important people
could have a meeting.  A few paces away from the table is a reasonably
clean stone scribe's desk.  Nearby is a drying rack where clay tablets
can cure before they are ready to be fired, making a long term record of
any important documents.  A fairly mod-looking fan service is arranged
through a series of leather-strap pulleys corded from the ceiling,
allowing a slave to move a volume of cool air through the room
alleviating heat on the guests.  On one wall of the room is a map
depicting the City- State of Tyr.  The map has been highly stylized to a
degree of almost artistic scope with a series of attractive graphics.  Two
staircases are here, one leading up above and the other down.

Slave Quarters~
     This area is a slave quarter.  Typically, one might find one or
more slaves here, working, playing or resting.  Bales of hay lie in a
stack, where the slaves can use them for bedding or to ply their crafts.
Two fire pits are situated in the floor, with ceiling vents.  Drying
pieces of chitin and other bits of animals are usually strung from pegs
on the walls, of a sort that could only be of interest to a slave.

     This loft has a high, gabled ceiling.  The structure of the room
is supported by wood beams, which testify to the wealth of the room's
owner.  The walls are made of adobe bricks, of a higher quality than is
used in civil or residential construction.  Many of these bricks have
simple geometric patterns etched into their face, creating repetitive
units every few tiers.  Shelves line one wall.  The floor is covered in
scented floral blossoms that are seldom more than a few days old.  A

any important documents.  A fairly mod-looking fan service is arranged
through a series of leather-strap pulleys corded from the ceiling,
allowing a slave to move a volume of cool air through the room
alleviating heat on the guests.  On one wall of the room is a map
depicting the City- State of Tyr.  The map has been highly stylized to a
degree of almost artistic scope with a series of attractive graphics.  Two
staircases are here, one leading up above and the other down.

Slave Quarters~
     This area is a slave quarter.  Typically, one might find one or
more slaves here, working, playing or resting.  Bales of hay lie in a
stack, where the slaves can use them for bedding or to ply their crafts.
Two fire pits are situated in the floor, with ceiling vents.  Drying
pieces of chitin and other bits of animals are usually strung from pegs
on the walls, of a sort that could only be of interest to a slave.

A Spacious Loft~
     This loft has a high, gabled ceiling.  The structure of the room
is supported by wood beams, which testify to the wealth of the room's
owner.  The walls are made of adobe bricks, of a higher quality than is
used in civil or residential construction.  Many of these bricks have
simple geometric patterns etched into their face, creating repetitive
units every few tiers.  Shelves line one wall.  The floor is covered in
scented floral blossoms that are seldom more than a few days old.  A
staircase is the only visible exit.

A Dank Cellar~
     The brick walls are bulging here and there behind the weight of
the dirt behind them.  One questions the integrity of the building
foundation.  Old and deteriorated empty crates occupy a good portion of
the dirt floor space down here.  The basement does smell just slightly
musty, a rare smell in the bone-dry climate of Athas.  A set of shackles
are bolted to one wall.  A staircase is the only exit.

     This garden has a number of desert plants that have been
cultivated.  A few of the plants bear fruits that one might think could
be plucked fresh for cooking.  Other of the plants have flowers, but no
visible fruits, presumably grown for decorative purposes.  The
predominant growths here are a variety of cacti, which are best suited to
the growing conditions here.

Manor House~
     The decor inside this manor house is nothing short of impressive.
Stone block has been augmented with dyed bricks to create a modest
panorama of masonry surrounding the space.  Great pain has been taken to
avoid any painting or blatant sculpture, however few turns of the
architectural program have been executed without some pleasing
embellishment.  This is a place of luxury.

The shambles of the Slave Quarters.~
     These Quarters serve as both a work space and a living space for
the slaves that work at the estate, and also for a handful of freeman
servants as well.  Certainly a layer of grime covers most of the space,
but it is kept in better shape than much of Tyr.  It would be rare not to
spot a few slaves, either sleeping, relaxing or preparing some manner of
hand craft for use in the manor house.

Great Hall~
     This large hall is comprised of a series of about seven bays.
Each bay is crowned with a modest clerestory, from which the light shafts
have leather service flaps that can be battened from a network of straps
to keep out sand storms.  The central bay is an accentuated atrium, set
apart only geometrically from the rest.  The next bay seems more than
anything an excuse to construct a series of four rows of alcoves.  Two of
these rows are ground level, yet the other two are several lengths off
the ground.  The smallest bay is also the tallest, whose expanded ceiling
has left room for a pair of arches that do not actually support the
ceiling, yet showcase a set of imported bricks.  Bay four is barrel
vaulted with bricks that have been finished to a glossy texture, but
otherwise is drab, doubtlessly as deliberate contrast to its companion
spaces.  Bay five and six are cruciform branches from three, perhaps as
antecedents to what could prematurely be termed a basilica.  The last bay
has a exhibits a colonnade, whose columns have been constructed of some
remarkably spotted marble.

     This storage vault is built of heavy block.  The ground is made
of brick.  Sometimes wealth might be stored here, but not always.  Other
than that, there is not too much elaborate about the room.  It is smaller
in structure than most of this guildhall.  Surely, it serves adequately
as way to keep thieves out of the business of an important guild.  Very
little filth has been allowed to accumulate here.

A Large Ballroom.~
     This large room is too wide for vaulting, and so is thatched.  A
few spots on the wall are lighter in hue than the stones around them,
where paintings may have once hung.  It is unlikely that one would find a
ball in progress.  Balls have been illegal in Tyr for some time.  More
than anything, this room attests to the age of the building.  The air
smells of ozone, and the room is kept reasonably clean.

A Large Ballroom.~
     This large room is too wide for vaulting, and so is thatched.  A
few spots on the wall are lighter in hue than the stones around them,
where paintings may have once hung.  It is unlikely that one would find a
ball in progress.  Balls have been illegal in Tyr for some time.  More
than anything, this room attests to the age of the building.  The air
smells of ozone, and the room is kept reasonably clean.

Great Hall~
     This large hall is comprised of a series of about seven bays.
Each bay is crowned with a modest clerestory, from which the light shafts
have leather service flaps that can be battened from a network of straps
to keep out sand storms.  The central bay is an accentuated atrium, set
apart only geometrically from the rest.  The next bay seems more than
anything an excuse to construct a series of four rows of alcoves.  Two of
these rows are ground level, yet the other two are several lengths off
the ground.  The smallest bay is also the tallest, whose expanded ceiling
has left room for a pair of arches that do not actually support the
ceiling, yet showcase a set of imported bricks.  Bay four is barrel
vaulted with bricks that have been finished to a glossy texture, but
otherwise is drab, doubtlessly as deliberate contrast to its companion
spaces.  Bay five and six are cruciform branches from three, perhaps as
antecedents to what could prematurely be termed a basilica.  The last bay
has a exhibits a colonnade, whose columns have been constructed of some
remarkably spotted marble.

Around Some Stands and Stalls~
     The stands and stalls are packed rather tightly inside this
emporium.  One has to wind one's way back through the maze of shops in
order to find the best deals.  The vendors here are considerably less
pushy than the street vendors.  They rely more on the taste and
discretion of shoppers to spot a good deal.  Some of the vendors here
have brought their children to work with them.  A dozen scents assault
the senses, to include leather, chitin, wool, food, sand, soil, sweat,
incense, spice, oil, straw, and ash.  It would take hours to poke through
literally every bin, kiosk, stand and table.  Some of the merchandise
seems first rate, but much of it leaves one wondering how the vendor is
able to make a living selling it.  Periodically, one or more of the
vendors will take a break from their shop keeping to unroll a prayer mat,
where they will kneel for a few moments as they pray to Kallak for good
fortune.

order to find the best deals.  The vendors here are considerably less
pushy than the street vendors.  They rely more on the taste and
discretion of shoppers to spot a good deal.  Some of the vendors here
have brought their children to work with them.  A dozen scents assault
the senses, to include leather, chitin, wool, food, sand, soil, sweat,
incense, spice, oil, straw, and ash.  It would take hours to poke through
literally every bin, kiosk, stand and table.  Some of the merchandise
seems first rate, but much of it leaves one wondering how the vendor is
able to make a living selling it.  Periodically, one or more of the
vendors will take a break from their shop keeping to unroll a prayer mat,
where they will kneel for a few moments as they pray to Kallak for good
fortune.

Inside an Alley.~
     This alley is wide enough to navigate a carriage through,
provided that the driver is going slow.  Large piles of sand accumulate,
probably swept here off of the streets by slaves.  Not much attention has
been paid to beautifying this space.  As with most alleys in Tyr, it
serves mostly as access to the rear entrances and service entrances of
the buildings here.  The sound of children screaming drifts through the
alleys here.  Much of Tyr is a young population, with the majority being
well under thirty-five years in age.  Gazing about the alley, it is not
hard to see why this might be the case.  A variety of factors, mostly
related to health in one way or another, prevent most folk from reaching
a venerable age.  The stench here in the alley is sickening.  A variety
of plant and animal matter -- some of it already digested, sits rotting
here in various states of decomposition.  A few puddles of scum have
something recognizable floating in their center.  Every few foot steps
one risks stepping into something soft, which usually isn't worth looking
at any further.

Inside a Warehouse~
     Large brick and stone racks line up most of the space here.  There
is room between the rows for a giant or a pack beast to maneuver,
especially under the guidance of a handler.  These racks can hold large
amounts of goods and materials while they're in transit.  The roof of
this building is thatched.  The walls are comprised of bricks.  Trash
lines the corners.

Inside of a Bone Cage~
     This region of the warehouse is wrapped in a cage of bone.  It
would take a dedication to get into, and no doubt serves to deter casual
theft.  A bone cage is a place for smaller, more expensive merchandise to
be stored.  The lock on the cage restricts access to those who have a
key.  The lengths of bone are lashed together with strong vine.  Smaller
shelves are lined up here.

Overstock~
     This region of the warehouse is open and has been left free of
shelves.  A few empty crates sit in one part.  When large items must be
stored that will not fit on shelves, this would be the place.  The roof
overhead is thatched, and the walls are comprised of adobe bricks.  Small
light shafts allow light to enter from overhead, as well as some
ventilation.

Inside a Warehouse~
     Large brick and stone racks line up most of the space here.  There
is room between the rows for a giant or a pack beast to maneuver,
especially under the guidance of a handler.  These racks can hold large
amounts of goods and materials while they're in transit.  The roof of
this building is thatched.  The walls are comprised of bricks.  Trash
lines the corners.

Inside of a Bone Cage~
     This region of the warehouse is wrapped in a cage of bone.  It
would take a dedication to get into, and no doubt serves to deter casual
theft.  A bone cage is a place for smaller, more expensive merchandise to
be stored.  The lock on the cage restricts access to those who have a
key.  The lengths of bone are lashed together with strong vine.  Smaller
shelves are lined up here.

Thorax~
     This is the rotund middle portion of the granary.  The walls are
constructed of bricks.  Very little light or ventilation gets in here.
The air is dry.  A few splinters from a bone tool lie on the bottom.  It
is there that a few blind beetles and worms fight over a few pinches of
grain that have been left here no telling how long ago.  Since this space
is empty, one can only presume that the grain storage of Tyr is slightly
below capacity.

     This is the top of the granary.  It's currently empty.  It's very
possible for a reasonably endowed person to suspend oneself against the
side by pressing one's legs against one half, and one's back against the
other, but this takes strength to maintain for too long, especially for
anyone of great girth.  The walls of this silo are made of brick.

are a few dozen writing benches.  Fan services, manned by slaves, serve

small glass-pained windows.  Frequently, one or more templars will be

Inside a Vault~
     This vault is lined with adobe bricks.  Sometimes it is occupied
with a few crates that are filled with sensitive documents.  Other times
it is nearly empty.  Cobwebs line one of the walls.  A few of the bricks
show cracks where a huge weight must have rested on them.

Scrivener's Room.~
     The scribe's room occupies the best space of the building.  In it
are a few dozen writing benches.  Fan services, manned by slaves, serve
to comfort the templars who work here.  A few spots on the stone floor
are stained with spilt ink.  Light enters the room through a pair of
small glass-pained windows.  Frequently, one or more templars will be
here writing, attended by slaves.

Filing Room~
     This room holds crates of vellum, and piles of clay tablets.
These documents would be of little interest to most commoners, who don't
know how to read or write.  Little or no attention is paid to cleaning
the room.  Dust piles up in the corners.  Small light shafts near the top
permit a modicum of illumination to the room.  The floor is comprised of
packed clay.

Hall~
     A number of load-bearing columns mark this hallway apart from
most of the less impressive walkways of Tyr.  They are set upon fairly
shallow impost blocks.  The walls are constructed using ashlar masonry.
This hallway stretches perhaps a third of a mekillot- length.

In a Small Alcove.~
     This alcove is rounded, somewhat of a half sphere.  The ground is
flat.  The wall is lined with strips of polished wood.  Part of the space
of this alcove is taken up by a massive stone bench, which is set into
the wall here.  Effectively, it is a single slab of stone.  A bone
curtain rod is near the exit of the alcove, at the top.  No curtain hangs
from it.

Workshop Backroom~
     This back room is obviously meant for storage.  A rack is stands
next to one wall.  Whether the rest of the room is filled with work
materials largely depends on what point of the building cycle or work
week one is at.  The ground is made of packed sand.  No great care was
made in the construction of this room.  It seems to be purely made as a
workspace.

Sleeping Room~
     This room is darker than the outer room.  The bricks are slightly
darker in hue, and don't reflect light very well.  It's not bad by Tyrian
standards for a place to sleep.  The pallets that line the ground are
straw, but the straw is clean.  Each has a layer of linen over top to add
some comfort.  A rack on one side of the room provides a place to drape
clothes when they are not in use.

Brick Storage Room~
     Judging by its proximity to the Ziggurat, this storage room is
probably used to store adobe bricks until they are needed.  A few bricks
can usually be found here, of various sizes and hues.  Some bricks even
have curious shapes, like in the case of the curved bricks that are used
in round masonry, or the scallop bricks that are used for gardens.  This
room tends to accumulate a good amount of brick dust.

     This room is about ten arm-lengths by eight arm-lengths.  It is
constructed of bricks, its masonry style and quality not atypical of many
of the civic buildings of Tyr.  It is grand compared to commoner's
housing, but lacks the virtue of the stone construction employed in a
Templar's Office or a Temple.  An officer usually presides over this
room, having a Magistrate's Bench from which to officiate the guard
shift.  Subordinate soldiers come in and out, bringing the officer

Shop~
     Looking around, its safe to say that this is a workshop, and
probably a fairly serious one.  Several pieces of knotted string lie
about, no doubt used to measure things.  The work tables and work benches
are fairly well designed and tooled, equipped with things like bone vices
to make work easier.  Here and there bits of polish and other spilled
fluid have stained the room.

Crafthall~
     Any experienced artisan might be able to tell that this crafthall
would be the sort used by a master craftsman.  The room is well set up
for serious work, and the sand on the floor has been recently broomed and
raked.  The thatched roof has been chitin-reinforced at one point, and
supports a simple pulley system.  The pulley might be used to lift or
suspend heavy objects while they are worked on.  Bent, discarded chitin
nails have been kicked under a workbench.  A few charcoal stains remain
from a work diagram that someone might have used in a construction.

are fairly well designed and tooled, equipped with things like bone vices
to make work easier.  Here and there bits of polish and other spilled

Crafthall~
     Any experienced artisan might be able to tell that this crafthall
would be the sort used by a master craftsman.  The room is well set up
for serious work, and the sand on the floor has been recently broomed and
raked.  The thatched roof has been chitin-reinforced at one point, and
supports a simple pulley system.  The pulley might be used to lift or
suspend heavy objects while they are worked on.  Bent, discarded chitin
nails have been kicked under a workbench.  A few charcoal stains remain
from a work diagram that someone might have used in a construction.

Brick Shed~
     This brick shed allows the slaves that tend the Royal Gardens to
work outside of the burning sun.  A few work tables are in evidence.  The
room has the smell of recently trimmed plant life.  Pieces of plant
matter litter the floor.  Light is able to get in through a pair of light
shafts near the ceiling, supported by stone lintels.  During the daytime,
it's not unusual to bump into a slave working here, or more usually
congregating and slacking off.

few pinches of loam litter the otherwise sandy floor.  A few cracked and
discarded plant pots have been tossed aside.  It's possible that some of
the garden slaves use this space for sleeping purposes, as there is a
straw pallet here that conceivably doesn't belong.

Arcade~
     This arcade stretches for some length into the Ziggurat.  The
first colonnade has line inscribed columns.  The capitols of these
columns are detailed to appear as though a human hand is rising out of
the column, and holding up the roof.  The next line of columns is inlaid
with a swirling pattern.  The capitols of these columns are detailed to
appear as though a curve-featured stone lizard is sleeping on top of the
column, the weight of the roof resting on his back.  The next line of
columns is detailed with dragons.  Each additional line of columns
follows a design program, but the nature of the inscriptions and beasts
becomes increasingly unfamiliar and arabesque.

     An altar lies at the end of a long ambulatory, set in front of a
glass-decorated apse.  The base of the altar has been set with a
triptych.  The first panel of the triptych has been hand painted with a
series of geometric figures that could conceivably be of Urik design, but
otherwise evoke no familiarity to most viewers.  The second panel has a
relief engraving that has a minimalist representation of a dragon.  The
last panel is painted with a series of calligraphic shapes, but the
stylization of the script is too intricate to allow for easy discernment
without the help of a sage.

glass-decorated apse.  The base of the altar has been set with a
triptych.  The first panel of the triptych has been hand painted with a
series of geometric figures that could conceivably be of Urik design, but
otherwise evoke no familiarity to most viewers.  The second panel has a
relief engraving that has a minimalist representation of a dragon.  The
last panel is painted with a series of calligraphic shapes, but the
stylization of the script is too intricate to allow for easy discernment
without the help of a sage.

Arcade~
     This arcade stretches for some length into the Ziggurat.  The
first colonnade has line inscribed columns.  The capitols of these
columns are detailed to appear as though a human hand is rising out of
the column, and holding up the roof.  The next line of columns is inlaid
with a swirling pattern.  The capitols of these columns are detailed to
appear as though a curve-featured stone lizard is sleeping on top of the
column, the weight of the roof resting on his back.  The next line of
columns is detailed with dragons.  Each additional line of columns
follows a design program, but the nature of the inscriptions and beasts
becomes increasingly unfamiliar and arabesque.

Shabby Room~
     This room has almost assuredly seen better days.  One wall is not
really in bad shape, provided that one disregards all of the smoke
stains.  A fire pit occupies a good portion.  Broken bones sit in a pile,
presumably the remains of a number of meals.  The rest of the walls are
missing the original bricks in a number of locations.  Patches have been
made with much cheaper bricks, obviously occurring in different stages
with bricks taken from a variety of sources.

Addition~
     This room has been added onto the side of the ruined building.
There isn't much to it.  The walls have been put up with haphazardly
stacked bricks.  To prevent the whole addition from falling over, the
walls have been tied together with scraps of cloth and a propped up with
packed sand and a few lengths of bone.  The sand on the ground has a
number of footprints, suggesting that the room sees frequent use.  Shards
of pottery have been swept into one corner, and are mixed in with a few
filthy shreds of fabric.

Inside a Ruined Building~
     The sand in here has the particular aspect of sand that has had
people living on it for a while.  Nothing else produces this quality in
sand.  Anyone who has lived long in the Tablelands might well be familiar
with it.  A number of smells strike the senses inside this tent.  Perhaps
foremost of them is the scent of leather.  A number of sounds reach the
inside of this tent.  Perhaps the strongest of them is the noise made by
children in their games, their struggles and their dramas.  This reflects
the predominantly young character of the crowd outside.  The
conversations of older persons do occasionally drift in, as though coming
from a distance.  Every now and then a round of deep-toned laughter is
audible, perhaps from a dwarf or a giant.  The walls of this tent are
made of a coarse canvas.  The canvas itself is likely linen.  Upon
further inspection of this material, one might note that the weave is
broad and the flax is likely of a low quality.  Doubtlessly, no great
expense was made in the preparation of this tent.

Sales Stand~
     The space inside this stand is dominated by a series of bone
racks.  The most of the bones in the rack frames are long, narrow and
pale yellow.  A skilled craftsperson could tell by the gentle facet of
their cut that they were probably splintered from some larger segments of
bone, fractured lengthwise to preserve their longest dimension.  Next to
a couple of racks are a few work tables.  The table surfaces themselves
are chitin segments overlaid with a thin finish of strong shale to
provide a level work area.  Bits of cording, pins rivets and fasteners
are strewn across the surface of the table.  Marks where hand-tools have
been bolted to the table are visible if one looks closely at the surface.
The walls are made of adobe bricks.  The bricks used to make the walls
have been laid in patches, presumably where extra materials had been
recycled from a variety of different jobs.  Most folks might not pay this
much mind, unless they are the sort of person who is obsessed with
details.

pebbles, are in evidence.  Most of the sand is a low-chroma orange color,
almost peach.  The sand has been smoothed and packed down enough that's
it's easy to walk or stand in.

make the walls have been laid in patches, presumably where extra
materials had been recycled from a variety of different jobs.  Most folks
might not pay this much mind, unless they are the sort of person who is
obsessed with details.  The ground here is covered mostly in sand, but a
few small and unobtrusive pieces of crumbly rocks, more properly termed
pebbles, are in evidence.  Most of the sand is a low-chroma orange color,
almost peach.  The sand has been smoothed and packed down enough that's
it's easy to walk or stand in.

     Next to a couple of racks are a few work tables.  The table
surfaces themselves are chitin segments overlaid with a thin finish of
strong shale to provide a level work area.  Bits of cording, pins rivets
and fasteners are strewn across the surface of the table.  Marks where

Inside a Slave Tent~
     The interior of this tent is fairly filthy.  Either the
inhabitants of the tent must care little for the condition that it's in,
or they must lack the ability to clean it.  While much of the grime from
the floors doesn't look like it's sticking too well to the sides of the
tent, more than a few stains give the canvas an unpleasant aspect of it's
own.  The sand in here has the particular aspect of sand that has had
people living on it for a while.  Nothing else produces this quality in
sand.  Anyone who has lived long in the Tablelands might well be familiar
with it.  A number of smells strike the senses inside this tent.  Perhaps
foremost of them is the scent of leather.  A number of sounds reach the
inside of this tent.  Perhaps the strongest of them is the noise made by
children in their games, their struggles and their dramas.  This reflects
the predominantly young character of the crowd outside.  The
conversations of older persons do occasionally drift in, as though coming
from a distance.  Every now and then a round of deep-toned laughter is
audible, perhaps from a dwarf or a giant.

Inside a Gazebo~
     This gazebo is made from thin planks of bone woven with wood to
make a wicker arrangement.  The top is shielded with white-dyed chitin to
provide shade for anyone pausing to admire the garden.  Floral vines wrap
around the structure that add a strong element of beauty.  With seasons
being as mild as they are in this part of the Tablelands, the gardens
show the splendor of Tyr consistently throughout the year.  Tiny winged
insects buzz about, pollinating plants.

Inside a Shack~
     Judging by the interior of this shack, the building is being used
as a residence.  The dirt has been packed down in places, suggesting that
someone or someone's has been using this place to live or work.  A couple
of straw pallets are lined up against one wall.  The walls themselves are
constructed of adobe bricks with chitin patches.  Scraps of fabric are
strewn about the floor, where they have gotten torn off of a blanket, or
some clothes, or perhaps where someone was using them to do some mending.
