10. A stat or info command showing weight carried, certain flags on PCs, their background (need to code) and other things like on arm.
11. Finish change command, got hands and Rob is doing ldesc.

Need a good system for large-scale battles.  The uunit system on arm is too shabby for my taste.

Subject Class List~
Text
Bard- Unique abilities such as palm, sing, combat abilities, craft mandolin, etc, etc.
Brute- Berserk ability.  Major abilities focused toward raging and going nuts in combat.  Very poor combat skills overall though.
Cleric (Air, Earth, Fire, Magma, Rain, Silt, Sun, Water) Self-explanatory.
Druid- Spells coming from the nature of Athas.  Ranging from an earthquake to a spell to a water creation spell.
Fighter/Warrior- Disciplined guards, captain in an army, that is what this is for.  Unlike Brutes.
Gladiator- Have not decided whether to use this as a class yet or not, if I do they will be very efficient killers basically assassins.
Psionicist, aka Mindbender- Self-explanatory.
*Psychic Warrior- Special app only.  Basically a cross between a warrior and a psion.
Ranger- Self-explanatory. Master of the bow, and tracking.
Rogue- Taking burglar, assassin, and pickpocket and putting it into one class.  The rogue will be the only class allowed to pick their skills.
Templar- Self-explanatory.
Wizard(Preserver and Defiler)- The magic system isn't even in so who cares right now.

If anyone has any ideas just email or note me.  This isn't the final list, more of a version 1.0 list of the classes.

Subject UPDATED TODO~
Text
1. Account system.  Going to need it sooner or later.
2. Falling out of air sectors and taking damage.  Also falling from climb-check rooms.
3. A number of toughness for walls, which will then be used in large-scaled battles with siege engines, etc to destroy the wall.
4. Perhaps an addition to OLC so we can set room echoes with rset. 
5. Gravity.  Going back to number 2, basically a gravity code for objects, people, BUILDINGS, etc.
6. More wear_locations, such as <over shoulder> (for sheathing swords and bows) Ten fingers.  Ability to sheath weapons on the back as well.
7. Conscious stat like hp and mana for being knocked out by psionics or clubs.
8. Custom code for special weapons, like throwing a chakra and having it come back to you.  Using spiked weapons and getting extra attacks, etc etc.
9. Poisoning code.
10. Tracking for rangers.  Blackjacking for rogues.  Some sort of rage code for Brutes.
11. A shatter code for obsidian/bone going up against steel/iron weapons.  Would like to see obsidian shatter basically everytime it goes up against so
-someone using steel or iron.
12. Always wanted to see some sort of fire code, for people who want to use fire arrows against wagons, argosies etc.
Would be very hard to come by however, getting the fire to burn on an arrow, would need oil etc.  Maybe a crafting system?
Also the fire code would be used for fireballs, instead of instant-damage it could set the person on fire, and they would take
X amount of damage for X amount of mud ticks.
13. Drowning in silt.  Silt storms near the sea, very dangerous so would need to do damage or give some sort of blindness maybe.
14.  Sandkicking at people's eyes to blind them. Sandstorms blind people. Rub command to rub at your eyes and get out sand/silt/etc.
Masks/hoods/veils/etc would loweer the chance of being blinded in a sandstorm, and some objects would render you immune to 
sandkicking.
15. Need to make thirst a high priority for pcs, not sure what the code does with it now.  But water should be needed
every IC day.
16.  A code for heat, such as strokes.  And for freezing weather, such as the desert night which gets down to 40 degrees F and even lower then that.
Possibly a melting code, or code for having your swords get stuck in their sheaths if it's extremely cold.

Just a few more things that could be done.

I'm presently pondering what clan/guild data structures require, so I can
decide how to implement them.  What variables do you all think
each character needs to store with respect to every guild in the game?
Currently, I believe they need:
A general faction standing - how much the guild likes you.
A membership variable.  Flag maybe?  or Rank?
A rank?  Is this really necessary, or just info characters need IC?
Flags for "rights" with guild resources.  commanding npcs, giving quests
to other PCs, etc.

Can any of y'all think of anything else?

Flags for "rights" is an excellent idea, being able to set these flags would be good too.  Ranks don't
really matter IC, but I will tell you something, players love to see their rank in their score or
whatever, mainly because it reminds them that they just got that 'sergeant' position or they are now
'war leader' of the mekillot raiders, you know?  Players just like many options that don't necessarily
do much for the immortals, but for them it makes them feel 'special' in their own way because
they worked hard to get that spot and stayed with the clan when it had no PCs.  So coding ranks just for
that would be cool, but just that, so that all ranks do is show it in score like
You are Delerak, Templar of Hamanu.
That's all I can think of, you pretty much have it all done in your note.

Subject Merchant Houses~
Text
Here they are.
House Stel - Based in Urik and Tyr.  Weapons and some armor.
House Shom - Based everywhere.  Major armor and weapons.
House Vordon - Based everywhere.  The only Usury Merchant House, banks in major cities, does loans, etc.
House Tsalaxa - A Merchant House dealing mainly in slaves around Tyr.
House Inika - Based in Nibenay and Gulg.  Deals in agafari, and wood from the forests there.
House Fyra - Based in Urik.  An underground house that looks like it deals in clothing, but actually has a blackmarket in Urik.
House Wavir - House that secretly employs mindbenders so they can have a monopoly on the clothing trade.
House M'ke - Minor House that deals mainly in hides and raw materials, employs hundreds of hunters.
House Ianto - Based in Tyr, works the human Blackmarket in Tyr, has close relations with Veiled Alliance there.

Do note that this is might not be a permanent list, I am always open to suggestions and ideas for
our Merchant Houses, these are from the Darksun Campiagn, so any original houses someone might
want us to have do post it.

Subject Class List 2~
Text
This is the newer list I've come up with.
Bard stays.
Brute stays.
Clerics all stay, we have the main elementals (powerful) fire, water, etc. and the others silt, magma etc are para-elementals.
Druids stay.
Fighters stay.
Gladiators are gone, they will just be specialized fighters with set skills.
Psionicists are now broken up into three different types. Will explain in more detail later.
Psychic Warriors stay as special app and imm only classes.
Ranger stays.
Rogue is being taken out and fleshed into three classes: Thief, Trader, and Assassin.
Templar stays obviously.
Wizard will be broken up into Preserver and Defiler, and another I think, but who cares right now.

Subject city-states/kings~
Text
	Stretching from the eastern gate of Urik to the entrance gate of the
Palace itself.  Way of the Lion is one of the shortest main roads in the
city-state.  It is used for travel between the behemoth Obsidian Road
and the other two massive roads Way of Vengeance and Way of Patience.
All types of races can be seen meandering along the mortarted road;
long-legged elves dashing along the street, dusty humans with a range of
characteristics, half-giants lumbering along their way clumsily, and
perhaps the rare mul striding alongside his master.  Soldiers patrol
daily and nightly, and it is not uncommon to see a yellow-cloaked
templar or two with the small units that circumvent the city.  The
massive palace can be seen rising over it's walled enclosure far to the west.
	The road continues east and west, to the north an alleyway moves
between the depots of merchant houses.
Urik - Hamanu (building)
Draj - Tectuctitlay or his son (building)
Tyr - Kalak (building)
Gulg - Forest-Goddess (need builder)
Balic - Androponis (need builder)
Nibenay - Nibenay (need builder)
Raam - Great Vizier (need builder)

These are all the city-states are their sorcerer-kings/queens.  Gulg and Raam both
have sorcerer-queens but I don't feel like digging them up right now.
I'm posting this because I need builders for the city-states that currently don't have
anyone working on them.  I'm pretty much loaded down with my 40% done Urik and my 1% done Tyr
so if anyone knows anyone steer them my way and we will try to get more builders working on the
other city-states.
