Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower,

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in

city walls in terms of height.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in

city walls in terms of height.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in

city walls in terms of height.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower,

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower,

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower,

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

High in the Air above a City~
This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

Up in the Air~
     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

This high up, one has an excellent view of the city below them.  
The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower, 
conspicuous on the skyline.  It is useful as a navigable feature in 
the air over the city.  Few other buildings even approach the tall 
city walls in terms of height.

     From here you have a good view of a few city blocks.  The tops of
most commoner's buildings have thatched, gabled roofs.  Most of the
larger buildings are barrel vaulted in stone or cut bricks.  Domes are
not to be seen.  There are less insects up this high than there are
closer to the ground.  The air is unpleasantly warmer during the day and
unpleasantly cooler at night.

The tallest discernable building is Kallak's golden tower,
