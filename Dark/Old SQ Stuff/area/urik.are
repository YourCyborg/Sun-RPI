grueling training, and Urikite soldiers must go through.  He carries
obsidian weapons and is clad in yellowish chitin armor.

a pudgy templar~
A pudgy templar in a yellow robe stands nearby, arms folded.
~
This sick-eyed templar is obviously in a natural state of obesity.
His pudgy upper body in a testament to a life of luxury and soft,
tanned skin shows that he spends no more then a few hours under the
fury of the crimson sun.  He bears a thick amount of fat below his
chin, gathering in folds at his throat and neck.  He peers about with
a cold glare, weighing his surroundings and the crowds with a lecherous
eye.

real description.  Heavily Standing a good seven arms tall, this
heavily-muscled human towers over the crowds here.  His blue eyes sweep
lazily over the road and his demeanor is that of boredom.  A long scar
moves over his firm jaw, jagged and torn.  A blanket of golden blonde
hair cascades down broad shoulders.  He wears his yellow templar robe
loose over his massive frame, and bulging muscles are visible beneath the
thin fabric.

A heavily-muscled dwarf stands near the entrance, a large hammer held over his shoulder.
~
This short dwarf inheriting both a low height and strength from his
parents bears a bulging physique.  His arms are corded with thick muscles
and stretch his thin leathers to near ripping.  Along his left cheek is a
deep laceration-scar and gives him a grisly look when he moves his lips
to smile or yawn or speak.  With dark eyes and a predominantly darker
tone of skin, his purpose is obvious as he watches the shop with a
hawkish alert gaze.

A short soldier with a scarred face stands guard here.

This human stands quite short for his race, only five arms high from his
head to his heel.  His tough face is marred by long jagged scars, each
one sewn shut and stemmed off.  He has a small, wiry build, and looks
like his speed would be his main defense and offense in a battle.  Brown
eyes and brown hair make up his notable features, simplistic, yet somehow
remarkable.

A massive, leonine young human with a flowing mane of blond hair sits here cross-legged.
~
Standing as tall as a hefty tablelands tree, this large, well-muscled
young man bears an air of confidence about him that would seem to grow
only on high ranking soldiers in an army.  He has a thick blonde beard
grown about his face.  Above his beard are two fierce eyes of the darkest
shades of brown, even farther up are two bushy eyebrows that seem
narrowed in thought or concentration at all times.  He has a full,
lustrous head of flowing blonde hair that grows out in locks of curls and
strands.  His muscled form appears physically strong and sturdy, his arms
are filled with striated muscle, and his abdomen flattens out into a
washboard stomach with small chaotic muscles stretching out in different
directions all over his veiny, sun-burnt skin.  His heavy bulk is sleek
and leonine, his ears are pointed backward and his jaw is brutish and
thick, while his teeth are each sharp points.

obsidian longsword~
an obsidian longsword~
An obsidian longsword lies here, bearing the emblem of Urik.~
This blade is crafted from obsidian, an element which holds a razor
sharp edge, but has the durability of glass.  It seems very simple and
spartan in nature, bearing no ornamentation or specific design.  The sword
itself is very long, reaching at least two arms in length, and it appears
sharp, but there is no telling when obsidian will shatter or simply break
in half.  The guardless handle is boiled leather wrapped tightly about the
bottom shaft of the obsidian, simple yet effective for a solid grip.
Burned into the obsidian is the walking man-Lion emblem of Urik.

where it gets it's name.  Two thick pieces of bone allow for the grid of

fuliginous steel-bladed steel bladed greatsword sword Supremacy~
a fuliginous, steel-bladed greatsword~
A massive sword, its metal blade a light-absorbing black, lies here.~
The most oustanding feature of this double-edged greatsword is its
complete and utter blackness, to the point of expelling all light.  As if
by some magical force, the dark surface of the steel blade is incapable
of reflection.  The entire razor-sharp edge of this blade has the ability
of splitting hairs to within an inch of the iron guard, which is very
spartan in nature, lacking any designs.  Both sides shoot straight up
evenly from the guard and end in an angled tip, sharp, but useless for
thrusting in such a heavy slashing weapon.  Inside the blade's fuller,
unbeknownst to the naked eye, is a narrow river flowing with a dense,
metallic liquid--keeping the blade heavy near the guard when held
upright, and heavy at the tip when brought down, granting even the
weakest of men the ease of usage of the sword without relying on brute
force.  The long, cylindrical hilt is made from a dark wood threaded with
more iron.  Capping the sienna wood handle is the pommel, an iron sphere,
simple and undecorated.  Etched onto the flat of the sword, in an
inconspicuous part of the blade, is the word "Supremacy" in small, jagged
inscriptions, emanating a glowing, white light.

Rising up from the floor, this tremendous bookcase carved completely
from rare agafari wood leans in from a far wall.  The sole contents that
fill the wooden shelves are bound volumes thick and thin, packed tightly

Other than the simple floral designs that weave upwards on the surface of
the vertical beams, the bookcase is rather bare in appearance and serves
a utilitarian purpose.

A pond lies in a corner of the large garden, hidden by trees and trickling softly, its surface floating with water lillies.~
Resting in the southwestern corner of the garden, nestled behind slender
saplings and bushes, is a decent sized pond, perhaps large enough to wade
across, and deep enough to dive under.  Its shallow shoreline is green
with fresh grass and spotted here and there by colorfully-petalled
flowers.  Numerous wide-bottomed water lillies, graceful pink and shot
through with streaks of violet, float on the surface of the calm waters,
which is clear and cool, absolutely refreshing for drinking.

     This open, seven-sided gazebo has a pointed roof, constructed
entirely from wooden panels, and is supported by seven vertical beams.
The entrance, merely a opening in the low, encircling railing, is roughly
a half-giant's shoulder length apart, easily accomodating the widest of
girth.  The wooden railing surrounding the gazebo, connecting the beams,
rises up to waist height, and is comprised of curvy poles set in
intervals.  The whole structure is carefully painted white, its smooth
brush strokes clearly evident in its artistry.  Underneath the ample
awning is a restful shade, providing temporary relief from the burning
sun.

A pure white cloak of silk lies here, it's fringe long and voluminous.~
This cloak is a pristine-white and hangs off the body slightly loose.
Golden fringe hangs from the edges of the cloak all the way down to the
bottom.  It is fairly plain except for the exceptional silk material
which composes the cloak, which seems to strangely enough, draw light
away from a source and make the area appear much darker.  Whether this is
an optical illusion somehow weaved into the material, or magic it a
mystery.  Hoodless and roomy, the cloak would fit a very powerfully built
human.

The Lions Den - Main Room~
     This large tavern is built from the ground up of solid obsidian.  Rumor
has it that the Lion of Urik himself ordered the miners to hire fifty
half-giants so that they could get the block back to Urik.  The business
boasts an impressive amount of tables, and is at least fifty arms from
wall to wall.  The bar is on the eastern side of the establishment, solid
obsidian, growing from the floor itself, it hosts about twenty barstools
of which are also part of the floor.  Busy at all times of the day, and
accepting anyone in Urik, despite race, and despite the caste of nobles
and commoners, whom seem to mingle quite well in this atmosphere.
     The most impressive part of the tavern itself is the northern
wall which is host to a carving of the Lion King, each intricate detail
has been chiseled into the obsidian, and filled with a a yellow ceramic
tiling, leaving it a black mural of greatness.  A crude map is pinned on
the southern wall, showing the cities main roads and structures.
     Obsidian stairs rise from the tavern itself, traveling up,
westwards, a public quarter can be seen and behind the bar to the east is
the kitchen.

The Lion of Urik Tavern - Upstairs~
     All types of people travel to and from the several rooms available on
the upper floors quite frequently.  A noble with a whore on his arm will
pass by every so often, his personal guards trailing not so far behind.
Two massive half-giants, both with wide, stupid grins on their faces will
lumber past on rare occasion.  While expensive, they provide ample
privacy for most customers, even if they do come at a high price.
       The stairs travel back down to the tavern.

The Lion's Den~
     Upon entering, one will find this spacious room in much contrast to the
main room of the tavern.  Quiet and peaceful, it seems the more civilized
members of Urikite society spend their time in here, wanting to talk
without a vomitting dwarven mercenary nearby.  The room was decreed by a
by a templar to have it's own name, and the owner of the Lion of Urik Tavern
simply started calling it the Den.  An archway leads back to the Main
Room, eastwards.

Way of the Lion~
     Stretching from the eastern gate of Urik to the entrance gate of the
Palace itself.  Way of the Lion is one of the shortest main roads in the
city-state.  It is used for travel between the behemoth Obsidian Road
and the other two massive roads Way of Vengeance and Way of Patience.
All types of races can be seen meandering along the mortarted road;
long-legged elves dashing along the street, dusty humans with a range of
characteristics, half-giants lumbering along their way clumsily, and
perhaps the rare mul striding alongside his master.  Soldiers patrol
daily and nightly, and it is not uncommon to see a yellow-cloaked
templar or two with the small units that circumvent the city.
     To the north, the loud, unmistakable noises of a tavern belch forth
onto the street.

long-legged elves dashing along the street, dusty humans with a range of

daily and nightly, and it is not uncommon to see a yellow-cloaked

The Lion of Urik Tavern - Kitchen~
     The chaos and pace of the kitchens matches that of the Main Room, or
could be seen as, surpassing it.  Waiters and Waitresses yell out orders
to the cooks, and pick up arriving meals.  Steam rises up in certain
parts, and in others fires are blazing.  The heat, stench, yelling,
noise, and over all atmosphere is simply nerve-racking.  A spilt tray,
irate wenches, and food thieves are rampant, making the kitchens a place
where one might not want to spend a very long time in.
       The Main Room can be seen to the west.

An Intersection - Way of the Lion and Way of Vengeance~
     This intersection opens up broadly from Way of the Lion.  A mammoth
road known as Way of Vengeance cuts through north and south.
Southwards the road snakes past the buildings and warehouses of
merchant houses, towards Javed's Way.  Northwards it heads toward the
great Obsidian Road, which spans all the way from the eastern walls to
the western walls or Urik, and is the main route to and from the main
commoners quarter.

thick mekillot bone, agafari, and it seems stone was used in it's
construction.  Outside you can see nothing but a clearing that soon
turns into one of the two roads that branches from Urik.  Several
soldiers of the militaristic city be seen patroling around the
gate.  Upwards atop the high yellow walls of the city, one can spy
a few scouts, walking back and forth and watching over the environs of
the city-state.

Outside the Eastern Gate of Urik~
     The toweering gate rises up from the fields of Urik here, bearing
an opening to the city-state which looks like a safe haven from the wild.
Here and there, people can be seen entering the busy gate from all forms
of society; field slaves moving to and from the cities food supply with
wicker baskets, commoners heading out on their mundane business, hunters
of the great merchant houses heading out on mounts to find raw materials,
soldiers patroling moving out to patrol the fields or coming back,
covered in sweat to end their shift, nobility of all sorts looking
haughtily around the dingy atmosphere from their carriages with their
noses upturned, even templars can be seen on rare occasion leading a unit
of half-giants out on a mission.
       To the north and south, a dirt path moves around Urik.  To the
east, a road of ancient weathered stones snakes through the fields, to
the west the eastern gate opens to the city-state.

mainly reserved for commoners higher up in the social order, such as
captains of the Urikite army, rich merchants, or perhaps a very skilled
blacksmith or two that are used for the nobility - whom also have their
quarter in the southern part of the city, nestled close to the palace of

An Intersection - Way of the Lion and Way of Patience~
     Two roads intersect here, one traveling west and east, the other
moving north and south.  To the west the huge palace of Hamanu, Lion
of Urik cannot be missed; the crowds and amount of soldiers seem to
lessen the closer the palace gets, most likely because the palace is
open to the public, but many people prefer to worship their god in
in priviate, however a few visit the well-known sanctum where one can
bring donations or simply pray in silence.  
     Northwards and southwards, Way of Patience takes one away from
the crowds and palace.  The hospitable, main commoners quarter lies
northwards, the mudbrick buildings can be seen even from this distance,
pressed together tightly.  Southwards is the secondary quarter, where
the more wealthy commoners can afford to live, and down Javed's Way to
the west, the estates of the nobles quarter are seen, some rising as
high as the Palace, as if challenging it to a duel in the heavens.

up with the Lion-Kings face caught in a powerful snarl carved into the
wood.  Templars and soldiers move through the fire-blackened agafari gate
with purposeful strides, commoners pass by, a basket of fruit or some
other sort of gift for his god bundled under one arm.  Half-giants flank
the gate, watching the sparse crowds with dull gazes.  Pass the open gate
a gravel path leads away from the obsidian walls and to the Outer
Sanctum, where a bountiful garden and prayer hall can be seen from here.
       An agafari gate opens to the west, which will allow access to

Way of Patience~
     The crowds of this road are nearly all simply-clad commoners, heading
northward to Obsidian Road, or heading back south to Way of the Lion.
The buildings flanking this road consists of large stone warehouses,
bearing the goods from various merchant houses.  Northwards the tall
mudbrick dwellings of the commoner's quarter rises over the warehouses,
looking like tall, savage brown giants compared to the clean, well-polished
gray stone of the warehouses.  
     The road continues north and south.

Way of Patience~
     The crowds of this road are nearly all simply-clad commoners, heading
northward to Obsidian Road, or heading back south to Way of the Lion.
The buildings flanking this road consists of large stone warehouses,
bearing the goods from various merchant houses.  Northwards the tall
mudbrick dwellings of the commoner's quarter rises over the warehouses,
looking like tall, savage brown giants compared to the clean, well-polished
gray stone of the warehouses.  
     The road continues north and south.

     Surrounding this road is the commoner's quarter, pressing tightly
against the aged stones.  The quarter surrounds Way of Patience
partially on the east and west, however northwards on Obsidian Road
the main size of the quarter is finally realized, thousands of
mudbrick buildings lie off the obsidian ground of that road, bearing
well over half the population of the city-state.
     The road continues north and south, off to the north the dark
obsidian slabs of Obsidian Road can be seen.

the road. A mass of commoners head onto the obsidian, treading slowly
over the wide glass-like ground, however a few crowds still head south
towards Way of the Lion.
     Obsidian Road conquers Way of Patience to the north.

path, some pushing and shoving, some ambling along quietly.  Here and
there a noble can be seen lounging in his litter; held up by mulish
servants that wear nothing but a loincloth, tossing a copper or two
down to the greedy hands of the poverty-stricken, apparently more to 
get them out of his way then to be charitable.  Here and there on the
road, the soldiers of the city march on, enforcing Hamanu's Code.

Way of Vengeance~
     This road travels south to Javed's Way, and  bears light to no traffic 
at all. Mainly nobles walk along it's course, flanked by their guards.
However a few clean, silk-clad commoners can also be seen, moving with
a practiced stride of confidence.  A dirty beggar or two line the
sides of the road, hunched up against the large stone walls of the
warehouses, attempting to seek pity from any of the rich citizens or
patroling soldiers.  
     The road continues both north and south.

Way of Vengeance~
     This road travels south to Javed's Way, and  bears light to no traffic
at all. Mainly nobles walk along it's course, flanked by their guards.
However a few clean, silk-clad commoners can also be seen, moving with
a practiced stride of confidence.  A dirty beggar or two line the
sides of the road, hunched up against the large stone walls of the
warehouses, attempting to seek pity from any of the rich citizens or
patroling soldiers. To the east and west, two-story houses begin to
rise up, agafari doors now flanking the quiet door on both sides.
     The road continues both north and south.

     The road takes a slight bend to the south, turning into Javed's Way.

This small dusty road will take one to and from the Southern Gate of
Urik.  It cuts through several high buildings, which are quite possibly
the houses of the middle-class commoners.  The stones of the road are
a yellowish brick, and are cracked from age, while to the north the
newer reddish bricks of Javed's Way can be seen.

blockades the noble's quarter and is flanked by an entire unit of
guard.  The estates and houses can be seen far above the gate, the
shingled roofs and shuttered windows a delightful image to the Urikite
nobility, but quite probably a contemptful one to the Urikite commoner.  
     A gate rises westwards, preventing all those without the proper

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.
     To the east and west the road continues, while southwards another
road constructed of old gray stone cuts off toward the center of
the city.

     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.
     To the east and west the massive road continues, off to the northeast
of the road a larger crowd can be seen milling about.

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.  The hustle and bustle of trade in  Urik's
enormous Market pours onto the road from the north.
     The road continues east and west.  The sprawling Market of Urik
lies to the north, the size and sound intimidating from this vantage point.

wheels, huge argosies and their mekillots paw prints, various
humanoid boot prints - some as large as a half-giants.  The road moves
from Caravan Gate southwards to the merchant's quarter, it also serves
as an unloading point for some argosies who are so massive they will
not fit through any other road, save Obsidian.  Most wagons however
will unload off Obsidian Road and trek their wares southwards to the
warehouses.  The crowds here are mainly wandering merchants, trying to
sell wares, but the great Market of Urik is northeast of this road.

not fit through any other road, save Obsidian.  Most wagons however
will unload off Obsidian Road and trek their wares southwards to the
warehouses.  The crowds here are mainly wandering merchants, trying to
sell wares, but the great Market of Urik is northeast of this road.  
     The road continues north and south.

Caravan Way - Gated Entry~
     The dust accumulates thick on this road, as if attracted by some
unseen eddy.  Tracks of all sorts can be seen in the dust; wagon
wheels, huge argosies and their mekillots paw prints, various
humanoid boot prints - some as large as a half-giants.  The road moves
from Caravan Gate southwards to the merchant's quarter, it also serves
as an unloading point for some argosies who are so massive they will
not fit through any other road, save Obsidian.  Most wagons however
will unload off Obsidian Road and trek their wares southwards to the
warehouses.  The road stops near a large agafari and bone gate to the
south; which appears to be the entrance to the great Merchant Houses
estates and rarer warehouses.
     The road continues north and stops at a gate to the south.

Path to Southern Gate~
     This wide cobblestone path skirts off Javed's Way, moving south to the
a huge reinforced gate that is visible even from here.  Crowds, mainly
consisting of nobility move along this road, in small carriages pulled
by lavishly-painted kanks or carried along by several expensive muls.
Here and there a breeze stirs up, but catches nothing but bodies in
it's grasp.  The road looks swept immaculately clean, and every so
often a slave can be seen on the road with a straw broom, gathering
dust and sand into a bone dustpan.
     The path continues north to Javed's Way and south to the gate.

Southern Gates of Urik~
     A reinforced mekillot-bone gate lifts high into the air here,
open at all times unless weather or war comes near Urik, which is a
rare thing.  The nobility use this road for easy access to the
southern fields of Urik, because it is so close to their quarter.
Some commoners can be seen using it as well, but they seem to be far
better off then the average citizen of Urik.
     Cobblestones trail off northwards down a path, while to the south
the immense Southern Gate lies in between the yellow walls of Urik.

Cobblestone Path~
     This cobblestoned road, if it can even be called a road, is nothing more
then a wide open area leading around buildings east of Way of Vegeance.
Here and there a person can be seen entering a warehouse or a private
quarter.  While it is mainly deserted a few people can be seen strolling
about, preferring this quiet part of the city-state opposed to the more
crowded main streets.

Obsidian Road~
     Weathered slabs of obsidian are set perfectly even on this road, aptly
named for the material used in creating it thousands of years ago.
In some places cracks and holes can be seen, which are worked on daily
by strong slaves who can carry the obsidian slabs. All types of
Urikites move across the road; the main force being commoners heading
to and from home or moving to one of the many taverns of the
commoner's quarter, nobility riding in litters to Caravan Way where
they perhaps are embarking on a small hunting trip or some other sort
of entertaining activity, half-giants, dwarves, and long-legged elves
are the more rare occurance but can still be spotted here and there in
the human crowds, templars and units of soldiers with hard faces also
tread over the long street, keeping the peace and enforcing Hamanu's
Code with cruel haulings to the jail. This road is perhaps the most
busiest in the city-state.
     To the east and west the massive road continues, off to the northeast
of the road a larger crowd can be seen milling about.

     The road abruptly ends to the east, blocked by a high yellow
wall, while northwards a path of cobblestones leads to a crowded plaza.

Cobblestone Path - Nearing a Plaza~
     This short path leads north to a large plaza, crowded with commoners.
The road is wide, and the covered with cracked, aged cobblestones which
seem to be worked on daily.  Slaves toil in the heat of the day, lugging
large jugs to and from the plaza, while others are performing other
outside detail.

Sandstone Plaza - Watering Hole~
     This large, open plaza bears the stench of a mob.  Sweat, dust, decay
and other crude odors fill the air, choking anyone not familiar with the
senses.  Near the center of the plaza is a guarded water hole, which
dispenses a clear, bountiful liquid to the parched lips of those with the
coin to pay.  Many soldiers stand nearby, scanning the plaza with
disciplined gazes, and nearby the scrutinizing looks of several templars
pan out over the crowds.

Blades and Bulwark~
     The stone walls of this building are draped with all sorts of
obsidianweapons, their razor sharp edges gleaming dull in the torch
light.  Whiledealing mainly in obsidian swords, the shop does bear the
rare boneimplement here and there.  Along the eastern wall a counter is
reservedfor leather armor of all types, from helmets to fitted
chestplates andeven codpieces.  A rugged human passing through at times,
bearing a cracked obsidian sword is not uncommon, while a tall, sly-eyed
elf enters with a grin, sending a few shoppers out the southern archway.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market place.  Obsidian Road can be seen stretching along
to the south, the trading continues east, west and north.

noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  The high granite wall of a building rises to the west.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two

boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market place.  A ten-arm high wall looms to the east.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible far to the northern
end of the Market.  To the east, north, west, and south the Marketplace
continues.

The Market of Urik~
     A myriad of smells, attractions, and senses mix in discord, the
Market of Urik is known for two things: its size and its chaos.  Stalls,
boothes, even wandering peddlers crowd the Market which is in itself a
massive open area paved with cobblestones.  Elves are rampant about the
plaza, but are watched carefully by patrolling soldiers and templars.
Hides, bones, and other various raw materials are slung up here and
there, trying to be sold by a hunter or haggler who retrieved the hides
at a lower price.  Beggars can be seen every ten or twenty arms through
the Market area, some maimed in some sort of fashion, others simply
covered in filth.  The sights vary so greatly that at one point the
hoarse voice of a shouting trader sails by, then a dashing elf, or the
unwashed stench of sweat hanging in the dank air assails the nostrils,
the entropy and chaos reigning free, and even the slow canter of a
noble's carriage moving over the sandy cobblestones, this is the center
of trade for nearly all the Tablelands, and has been for the past two
thousand years.
     The high yellow walls of Urik are visible just to the north while
in every other direction the chaos continues.

Mudbrick Dwellings - Commoner's Quarter~
     An accumulation of dust, grime, and dirt-encrusted stones make up
this massive open area of crumbling mudbrick buildings.  The truly poor
would have to live in this area of the city.  Fecal matter and other
refuse can be seen simply piled in large clumps or pushed to the side
with some implement.  Humans and elves dominate the dirty quarter,
entering or exiting their homes perhaps heading to work, or to some other
engagement.  The familiar yellow armor and robes of the templerate are
very rarely seen here, and seem only to come for some minor dispute or
disturbance.
     To the north the perfect stones of Obsidian Road glimmer.

     An accumulation of dust, grime, and dirt-encrusted stones make up
this massive open area of crumbling mudbrick buildings.  The truly poor
would have to live in this area of the city.  Fecal matter and other
refuse can be seen simply piled in large clumps or pushed to the side
with some implement.  Humans and elves dominate the dirty quarter,
entering or exiting their homes perhaps heading to work, or to some other
engagement.  The familiar yellow armor and robes of the templerate are
very rarely seen here, and seem only to come for some minor dispute or
disturbance.
     To the north the perfect stones of Obsidian Road glimmer.

Dark Alleyway~
     This straight alley runs between two buildings, dark and bearing various
refuse pushed to the sides, it is not a very public road.  The alley
appears deserted but the feeling of being watched is very high here, and
unusual noises are heard echoing through the dank alley.
     The alley continues north, while to the south a cleaner, broader
street opens up from the mouth of the alley.

Dark Alleyway - Between Warehouses~
     Two massive warehouses rise to either side of this alley, looming above
the narrow road.  The warehouses come so close that it would leave barely
enough room for for a small unit of guards to pass through.  There are
large, weathered doors to the warehouses every twenty arms down the road
or so, each bearing a bone frame, reinforced with stone fittings.  The
warehouses do not look to belong to any specific merchant house, but do
look to be accessible through another door somewhere, as this would be
the back entrances, or perhaps a quick exit.
     The alley continues north and south, flanked by massive warehouses.

     Two massive warehouses rise to either side of this alley, looming above
the narrow road.  The warehouses come so close that it would leave barely
enough room for for a small unit of guards to pass through.  There are
large, weathered doors to the warehouses every twenty arms down the road
or so, each bearing a bone frame, reinforced with stone fittings.  The
warehouses do not look to belong to any specific merchant house, but do
look to be accessible through another door somewhere, as this would be
the back entrances, or perhaps a quick exit.
     The alley continues north and south, flanked by massive warehouses.

Turn in Alleyway~
     This alleyway continues through the warehouses of Urik's merchant
houses.  Filth and excrement are in abundance here, and the occasional
rat can be seen scurrying by or nosing about in the trash.  Here the
alleyway twists suddenly, narrowing to the south through a door-lined
path of warehouses, and opening up to the west.

Dark Alleyway~
     Dark and dank, this alleyway is quite wide, with refuse and excrement in
abundance.  It is difficult for the sun to penetrate the high buildings
looming on each flank of the alleyway, appearing to be warehouses of some

The "Bloody Mouth" Bar~
     It is said that no one can visit this establishment and not leave with a
bloodied mouth, though that is not what the owner claims.  The name of
the bar by rumor got it's name from a popular drink it invented called
the Bloody Lion, which leaves the drinkers teeth and mouth quite red from
the extract of some rare fruit.  Regardless of how the bar was named, it
is a very simple place, and the rougher crowds seem to linger within it's
stone walls.  While sparse during the day, the crowds are known to grow
at night and several brawls break out, the simple stone design allows for
maximum damage to be done without breaking anything.
     The exit lies to the north, a simple doorway.

Prayer Hall~

create the long rectangle hall.  Commoners of all races, and all creeds
can be seen here, kneeling and praying to their God, mainly humans
dominate the crowds, but a half-breed or a rare elf can be seen now and
then.  The eastern archway is large and wide enough for the half-giants
that flank the exit, two torches burn in their sconces and keep light in
the hall.  Along the walls are several murals of the lion of Urik,
scourge of the Tablelands, King of the World, Hamanu in several of his
victorious battles.  At the end of the hall is an obsidian face of the
Sorcerer-King his mane a brilliant yellow sandstone, his eyes constist of
two gold gemstones, the mouth of the King is set open in a roar, and
filled with offerings to Hamanu from any who wish to place something for
him there.

A Bountiful Garden~
     The calm bubbling of a nearby pond can be heard in the distance,
one of the few sounds that break the serene silence of this secluded
garden, which is so dense and abundant it nearly resembles a small
forest.  Exotic flora with their spray of blossoms coloring the lush beds
with rich ceruleans and soft pinks, their delicate petals wet with dew,
sprout from the blooming bushes and the downy soil.  The fertile soil
remains cool with moisture due to the shady overhead shadow cast by the
many young saplings growing in the garden, their plentiful leaves
protecting the ground from the harsh glare of the sun, which still peeks
through the space between the leaves in roving slabs of silvery sunlight.
The airy atmosphere here is thick with the fragrance of aromatic flowers
and the earthy scent of damp mist.  A wandering gravel path, its little
stones a frosty white, circles aimlessly through the expansive garden,
ending at the obsidian-barred gates in each cardinal direction, set in
red-bricked walls overgrown with spidery vines.  As if to disrupt the
peaceful, meditative ambience, the unrelenting obsidian gates are latched
closed, keeping out the outside world.

the yellow-cloaked soldiers serving in the Army of Urik.  The road to the
west looks quite barren, yet well maintained, it is made of large slabs
of yellow stones, and is flanked by large stone buildings.  A templar and
his personal guard can be seen travelling at times on both roads, their
medallions marking which Bureu of the Templerate they work for.
     To the west and south the yellow and gray stone of the roads allow travel.

Way of the Templar - Palace Road~

merging with the bleach-white stones of Palace Road, which will take one
to the Inner Sanctum of Destiny's Kingdom.  The crowds here consist of
highly ranked templars, and a decorated general here and there.  The
Nobility of Urik are not uncommon travelling to the Inner Sanctum for
meetings or gatherings, from this point on the road the pristine golden
buildings gleam in the light magnificently, each one topped with a
carving of the Omniscient God of Urik, the Sorcerer-King Hamanu.

A Simple Room~
     This very simple room consists of agafari wood boards which groan
and creak beneath weightier subjects.  The walls are gray stone, scarred
and weathered with age, and in some places cracked and cut.  Hanging from
the square ceiling is a single chandelier of iron, aglow with a myriad of
candles, each one a variegated shade of beautiful colors which seem to
send a rainbowish glow over the room.

A Spiraling Staircase~
     When looked at from above, the spiral design of this stone
staircase is redolent of an ock'n snail shell.  The tight spiral railing
twists upwards in a seemingly neverending way, making the long ascending
trek a tiring one.  The bottom levels are visible through the small
opening created by the spiral and could perhaps incite the numerous
palace guards that trudge up here to throw things down it.  Other than
the peculiar architecture about this staircase, the rest of the stone
structure remains barren.

A Golden Hallway - At the Top of the Staircase~
     This long hallway stretches through the Palace long and lined with
varioud doors and rooms lining it.  Golden scrollwork the likes of which
can be seen in various places in the Palace line this hallway on the
walls, the strange symbols engrained into the stone somehow.  The
activity of this hallway is quite possibly the busiest anywhere in the
Palace, with slaves ambling about to and from various places on this
hall, or even a high-ranking general in the Army of Urik striding by,
golden cape trailing behind.  A templar or several are sometimes seen
moving by quickly, and not spending much time on this floor.

     Iridescent tiles coalesce to form this intersection of four
different hallways, each one a solid construction of stone, but sporting
a distinct color.  Each hallway is covered by a draping of beads which
are each a certain color, beyond which can be made out the same color of
the hallway: the western hallway a pitch-black, the eastern hallway a
royal-blue, the northern hallway a blood-red, and the southern hallway a
pristine-white.  What arcane meaning lies behind the colors remains
unknown.

obsidian.  Tapestries line the walls above the scrollwork and a long rug
of the brightest gold leads to the east.

Portal Chamber~
     This large chamber is very simple in design, a round architecture meets
an exit to the east to a large hallway.  The ground here is solid stone,
and appears to be very ancient.  Around the entire chamber are several
rips in reality which appear to take one to the location represented.
Though one can never know without attempting to step through, the power
itself radiating from this chamber would unnerve even the bravest souls
to attempt such.
     A hallway opens to the east.

A Dusty Study~
     The ceiling of this study is fixed with polished agafari
crossbeams for support, the speckled grain of the wood gleaming with a
lustrous sheen.  Stacking every possible opening of the bookcases that
tower on each wall are endless rows upon rows of leather bound volumes,
the sheer amount of books enough to make the room seem cramped and
leaning.  An expansive, mahogany-painted desk, its surface topped by a
marble slab sits in the center of the room above a darkly-woven rug that
spans the entire floor of the study.  All around, dust particles can be
seen floating through the air, especially dancing in the bright sunlight
when it washes in each morning from the tall, stained-glass window on the
northeastern corner.
     Through the massive wooden door to the south is the hallway.

A Cavernous Mess Hall~
     This lengthy mess hall stretches in both directions, east and
west.  The high ceiling here is capable of holding two half-giants
standing foot on head, and even then still enough to allow minimal head
space.  Along with the long and high-ceilinged nature of this room, the
relatively bare walls create cavernous acoustics that echo the sounds
within--shouts and calls of some of the palace guards that dine here,
clattering of dishes and utensils, and the shuffling of kitchen workers
that sweep through.  Clean-cut blocks of obsidian make up the tiles set
evenly in the floor.  Several solid obsidian pillars, a few arms in
diameter, line up in intervals down the hall.  Long rows of stone tables
and benches border the walls neatly here, the surface of the tabletops
marred with nicks and scratches from the knifework of certain artistic,
or bored guards.
       A curtained archway far to the east wall reveals a kitchen,
while an open archway to the south leads back to the blue hallway.

Palace Barracks~
     This large stone room is unpainted and simple.  A fountain
gurgles clear water in a corner and a pair of agafari doors lie to the
north.  Double-beds line the southern and western wall, perhaps several
dozen in number.  Palace guards can be seen coming and going, sleeping,
resting or engaging in some other mundane activity like gambling.  The
stern faces of each guard show their unwavering discipline to their job
which is the security of the Palace.
     An archway leads eastward back to the sanguine hall.

Officer Palace Barracks~
     This large stone room is lavish in design, with tapestries of battles
and paintings of old, long dead generals of the Urik Palace Guard.  There
are comfortable looking beds lining the walls which stretch north and
south, and bear curtains around them for extended privacy.  All sorts of
ranked officials bearing the elite palace guard attire pass by through
these barracks from time to time.
     The barracks stretch north and south, while the exit lies west to the hall.

Barracks Lavatory~
     This long room is quite clean and organized.  Round stone holes lie
along the walls, painted over with a thick mud.  The floor is solid stone
and obsidian sinks lie near a pair of water basins.  Palace guards come
and go through this area, cleaning themselves up at the sinks or using
the stone toilets.  It has an overall calm feeling.
     The exit lies to the south, two swinging agafari doors.

A Royal-blue Hallway~
     The unmistakable shade of royal-blue is painted in thick layers
over the blocky stones that make up the floor of this hallway.  Spilling
across the long corridor is a blue carpet with tassels of a different
blue hue.  The stone walls here are splashed with more blue paint and
broken irregularly by doorways that lead into further rooms.  Sconces jut
out of the walls, firmly clutching obsidian torches emitting an eerie
blue light.

A Spiraling Staircase~
     When looked at from above, the spiral design of this stone
staircase is redolent of an ock'n snail shell.  The tight spiral railing
twists upwards in a seemingly neverending way, making the long ascending
trek a tiring one.  The bottom levels are visible through the small
opening created by the spiral and could perhaps incite the numerous
palace guards that trudge up here to throw things down it.  Other than
the peculiar architecture about this staircase, the rest of the stone
structure remains barren.
