Text
Welcome to Rip's Quest.
Basically the mud is still under development and currently
increasing playability, adding/switching new zones, and
making a whole bunch of nifty (non standard Merc/Diku) junk.
Anyway, as for right now, it's a bit difficult to get
started... so here's some tips and hint.
.
Start: type 'race *race_type*' to pick a race.
at the healer in Ys, type 'pick *class_type*' to pick a class.
help files exist for all the races and classes.
Next, goto your guildmaster and type 'gain' to
gain a level.  You must be level 2 in order to 'save'
which basically sticks you into the player file.  You must
'rent' at a reception to save equipment and crap.  Rent is free, but goto a reception,
cuz just cutting link will leave you standing there, link
dead... a sitting duck.
ok. Here are the guilds and places to go from the healer in Ys:
Apocrathy - eeunnw
Metal Worker - eeunneesesw
Leather Worker - eeune
Rogue - ssswdwswuse (open grate ok?)
Poet - essus
Archpriest - wwssuessusw
Paladin - senw (no i'm kidding.. he wanders... find him!)
Ok to check out what you can practice, type 'practice' at
your guildmaster.  Then, you can train in that/those
skills by typing 'practice *skill_name*'.
Best way to get started is to go kill crap in Hell/Midgaard
like fidos, and maybe kill dogs in Ys, hmm and shire's
not too bad a place.  I wouldn't try the sewers yet tho.
gold is scare, so pick up what you can... and get a weapon.
food/drink is implemented in this game, as is mv (killer)
buy 'cup of spam' from the maid in Midgaard/Hell.
that will make you Full and Not Thirsty, other crap doesn't
do jack.  It costs like 15 gp or so. So get one when you
can!
Midgaard/Hell: sssesesssseeesssssss (to the north wall of it)
Reception at Ys: ennu
if other receptions don't work, goto Ys
if you can't practice at your guildmaster, goto Archpriest
For more help, read the man pages... snicker. (or ask me
or someone)

possible to come up with some weaker skills or allow continuing
practice in backstab.  Some other ideas are giving
them a way to increase their to hit bonuses when
attempting a backstab, or something.  Or, allowing increasing
of abilities (str, etc) by spending practices, as assassins
seem to have nothing to spend practices on besides bs, sneak, 
and hide.  Just some ideas.

--i think it would be THE place to play (for me anyways) cept it
has a few cheesy immorts, and more then a few cheesy laws.
--its got the 4 basic classes, 4 races, you can customize your
char (via skills) same way you could on Rivers of Mud, its merc
mud, and allows pkilling,,,problem is there is no level limit
on pkilling,,,so some 30th level asshole can kill all the newbies he
wants..and lots of guilds like order and such who think its their
right to tell people what to do..shrug...if i played there i think
i would quickly rub people raw and get gangbanged by 30th+ level
people,,so probably not worth it.
heh, so other then the fact that i dont want to play there, its not
not a bad mud.;)

Is there a way to build an area online?  Or any other

confusing myself between how it actually would look
spatially (3-dimensional), as opposed to here.  I know
that the exits and locations of rooms here don't have to make complete
sense, so I'm crossing myself up on paper.  As far as
the number of rooms goes, it will at least be near your
upper limit that you gave me earlier (300+).  This is
including all my dwarven defense ideas that I had
implemented in my own stronghold (some of which could
be stripped out to save space if need be).  Anyway,
I was just wondering if there were other ways to build
other than the program you've pointed out to me.  Thanks.

I was looking through some old articles last night and
I saw a couple of articles with stuff that could be used for
new skills, mostly for warrior types....

Instant Stand:  to counter bashing/tripping
Feint:  if successful, +2 tohit in the following round, if not, like kick
Parting Blow:  Free attack(+ tohit, +dmg) to those trying to flee
Drive:  Forcing foe in a certain direction(out exits)
Speed:  2x attacks for # of rounds (cost mega move?)
Stun:  Like a warrior bs, instant stunning (low % of success)
Weapon Breaking:  Self-explanitory, involves item saves or something, though
Feign Death:  Trick foe into stopping attacks

I'm not sure if any of these are usable or not, just some ideas.

forgot something...
about the dying thing, it's cool cuz i'm already max level...
but if some newbie dies a couple times it'll be fuckin hell getting back
to where he/she was...
tho, maybe that's what you want..dunno
might be better to have it go down to just zero or something...shrug

So when will there be new areas and new stuff to explore, eh?  I'm a bit
familiar with Y's and the sewers and am ready for some new adventures and
stuff.  So leave a note here to let me know that you are working on 
areas and that there will be some stuff to do soon.  Thanx :)

you didn't have prerequisite spell, detect magic.  I would
suggest going and practicing it, assuming
the mud has rebooted since this message was posted...
