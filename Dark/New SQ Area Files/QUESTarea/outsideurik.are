Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     To the east, the grain fields give way to the desert.

Desert~
     Sparse dunes decorate the terrain here, but for the most part the
small piles of sand here could be better described as ripples.  Darker
sands seem to accumulate near the crests of these ripples, creating a
wavy dark line effect.  The sand has a particularly glossy sheen to it.
It reflects sunlight rather painfully.  Torch-light responds more
aesthetically, responding in curious rosy reflections against the shiny
surface of the sand.  The individual grains of sand appear to be tiny,
smooth pieces of glass.  The truth of the matter is that they feel gritty
enough against any skin that gets exposed to them.

Desert~
     The sand here has a more granular property than most of the sand
of Athas.  The feet of passing animals and humanoids have a pesky habit
of sinking into the sand almost an eighth of an arm with each footfall,
making travel somewhat difficult.  With each stride, the resistance from
the sand drags against the musculature.  Laden pack animals face it the
worst.  The way gets easier to the west.  Tracks don't hold long on the
terrain here.  The gritty sand seems to find it's way under fur, between
scales, under clothing, around joints and into boots.  Its abrasive
texture will become familiar to anyone who travels this way frequently.

Desert~
     This land seems somewhat more forgiving than the tracts to the
south.  Occasional spots of scrub dot the landscape.  An observant
traveler might spot a small pile of midden or fur every few meks.  One
curious feature of the landscape that rarely fails to rapidly make an
impression upon an observer is a series of dune rings that lies on the
land.  This feature seems to be repeated several times here and there, in
a haphazard pattern stretching to the north and south.  One can only
speculate if these moderately sized dune rings are natural, man-made,
beast-made or are the work of the gods or other supernatural forces.

a stubby hill lie the ruins of a brick building.  Inside or outside of
the ruins is an arbitrary assignment.  Only two of the walls remain
appreciably standing, and those in such disrepair as to offer little
shelter from sandstorms, predators, sun light or arrows.  The
architecture style is an antiquated one, featuring efficient
construction, interlocking bricks and craftily imposted columns.  Perhaps
a skilled sage could yield ideas to the origin of the building, its
history or the genealogy of the persons who built it.  Few enough clues
remain for the casual observer.

Desert~
     Less plant-life is in evidence here than further to the north.
The sands here range in color from orange to yellow, and cake easily on
clothing, scales and leather.  Any tiny trace of sand that gets in the
mouth strikes the reveler with a peculiar and memorable taste, marking
any bite of food eaten here any sip of drink taken in passing with a
loamy but tolerable flavor.  Here and there the pieces of bricks can be
found where they become exposed by the wind.  The finding of a whole
brick is a rare event.  These fragments, along with small pieces of
undecorated pottery, leave testament to times immemorial.

Desert~
     This land seems somewhat more forgiving than the tracts to the
south.  Occasional spots of scrub dot the landscape.  An observant
traveler might spot a small pile of midden or fur every few meks.  One
curious feature of the landscape that rarely fails to rapidly make an
impression upon an observer is a series of dune rings that lies on the
land.  This feature seems to be repeated several times here and there, in
a haphazard pattern stretching to the north and south.  One can only
speculate if these moderately sized dune rings are natural, man-made,
beast-made or are the work of the gods or other supernatural forces.

Expanse of Desert~
     Less plant-life is in evidence here than further to the north.
The sands here range in color from orange to yellow, and cake easily on
clothing, scales and leather.  Any tiny trace of sand that gets in the
mouth strikes the reveler with a peculiar and memorable taste, marking
any bite of food eaten here any sip of drink taken in passing with a
loamy but tolerable flavor.  Here and there the pieces of bricks can be
found where they become exposed by the wind.  The finding of a whole
brick is a rare event.  These fragments, along with small pieces of
undecorated pottery, leave testament to times immemorial.

Desert~
     Although the passerby might speculate or observe the occasional
sunny day, this terrain is quite obviously the frequent victim of harsh
winds.  Eddies of sand-laden air swirl about here and there, and the land
to the west looks gentler by comparison.  Short, roundish dunes do
occasionally break the monotony of the landscape.  These dunes and even
the infrequent dwarfish rock formations bear the telltale scandals of the
ravaging winds.  No feature of the land long here remains without some
sign of erosion.  Signs of life are infrequent, and shelter difficult to
find.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.

Desert~
     Clusters of rock break the sand here and yes, even the occasional
boulder can be found poking it's nose through the surface.  The ground
becomes increasingly rocky towards the north and increasingly sandy
towards the south.  Wherever a few rocks have piled together, a cluster
of plants seems brave enough to eke a meager existence.  Brush, weeds and
coarse grasses are predominant.  The sounds of insect life are in
evidence with the chattering of tiny beetles rising and falling, against
the sound of click bugs chirping.

Desert~
     Firm croppings of rock here dominate the landscape.  Three or
four of the thinner ones are up to an eighth of a mek high.  Many of them
have the aspects of dunes, but in truth are great piles of stone that
have collected layers of sand that have been blown about by the wind.
Natural paths wind around each dune, making travel quite manageable, and
footing quite firm.  Inspections of the rocks reveal the stone to be
igneous in origin.  Visible flow to the grain is in evidence, and some of
the rocks are porous.  The piles become smaller the further south one
goes, as do the size of the individual rocks.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     To the south an ancient stone road cuts through the fields.

Desert~
     Sparse dunes decorate the terrain here, but for the most part the
small piles of sand here could be better described as ripples.  Darker
sands seem to accumulate near the crests of these ripples, creating a
wavy dark line effect.  The sand has a particularly glossy sheen to it.
It reflects sunlight rather painfully.  Torch-light responds more
aesthetically, responding in curious rosy reflections against the shiny
surface of the sand.  The individual grains of sand appear to be tiny,
smooth pieces of glass.  The truth of the matter is that they feel gritty
enough against any skin that gets exposed to them.

Desert~
     The dunes on the sand plains below have gradually risen in height
as they reach this point.  Foothills lie below you.  You now stand on top
of a small, gently sloped mountain.  Reaching this point was difficult.
Conceivably, it would be possible to ascend deeper into the mountains.
This would require assistance from some of the land's greatest
mountaineers, as well as top-quality mountain climbing equipment.  Such
knowledge and gear is truly rare on Athas.  This land is partially
blocked by these taller mountains.  Without a more serious mountain
climbing expedition, heading back seems to be the only viable option.

     To the west dunes stretch as far as the eye can see.  Foothills
lie to the north and south.  To the east, the begging of a trail can be
made out.  It winds its way up the side of a mountain.  Glancing around
at the heights of the various peaks, no other traversal of the lofty
heights is apparent.  Gazing up at the top of the mountains, the tips are
covered in a white substance, although the nature of it will be
unfamiliar to most Athasians.

Desert~
     This desert seems to go on forever, stretching across the landscape with
high and low dunes.  From here, if a traveler were to stand on the top of
a large dune and gaze to the southwest, they might detect the sight of a
large city to the southwest.  Most visible are the high, protective
yellow walls of the city.  Also on a clear day smoke from the cooking and
industrial fires rises up in a diffusing cloud above some quarters of the
city.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     The fields continue in all directions.

Between Mekillot Dunes~
     This narrow trail winds up through the mountains.  It would be a
tight fit for an inix.  Presumably this trail was discovered by mountain
goats.  No sentient agency would carve so winding and harrowing a path.
The presence of sand diminishes rapidly with altitude.  For many
Athasians, this will be their first place to travel where dust was not a
constant problem.  Frequent breaks are necessary to make up for the
thinness of the air.

The Desert~
     To the east dunes stretch as far as the eye can see.  Foothills
lie to the north and south.  To the west, the begging of a trail can be
made out.  It winds its way up the side of a mountain.  Glancing around
at the heights of the various peaks, no other traversal of the lofty
heights is apparent.  Gazing up at the top of the mountains, the tips are
covered in a white substance, although the nature of it will be
unfamiliar to most Athasians.

     The dunes on the sand plains below have gradually risen in height
as they reach this point.  Foothills lie below you.  You now stand on top
of a small, gently sloped mountain.  Reaching this point was difficult.
Conceivably, it would be possible to ascend deeper into the mountains.
This would require assistance from some of the land's greatest
mountaineers, as well as top-quality mountain climbing equipment.  Such
knowledge and gear is truly rare on Athas.  This land is partially
blocked by these taller mountains.  Without a more serious mountain
climbing expedition, heading back seems to be the only viable option.

     The dunes on the sand plains below have gradually risen in height
as they reach this point.  Foothills lie below you.  You now stand on top
of a small, gently sloped mountain.  Reaching this point was difficult.
Conceivably, it would be possible to ascend deeper into the mountains.
This would require assistance from some of the land's greatest
mountaineers, as well as top-quality mountain climbing equipment.  Such
knowledge and gear is truly rare on Athas.  This land is partially
blocked by these taller mountains.  Without a more serious mountain
climbing expedition, heading back seems to be the only viable option.

The Desert~
     Sand swirls all around you.  You cannot see.  This land is
ravaged by a terrible sandstorm.  The sandstorms of Athas last anywhere
from a few minutes to a couple of weeks at their very harshest.  The air
blowing behind the sands is extremely dry, rapidly draining moisture from
the body.  Visibility is extremely limited.  The possibility of stumbling
off of the edge of a cliff is very real.  Walking right into a nest of
ferocious beasts without realizing it is another threatening risk of
travel through a sandstorm.  Having already traveled several mekillot
lengths into the storm, your body is largely drained of strength.  Only a
fool would press on.  Turning back seems the only sensible option.
Perhaps passage will be possible in a few weeks time.

The Desert~
     The ground here is littered with scraps of papery chitin debris.
They crunch underfoot if stepped on too sharply, otherwise they feel soft
against the skin when handled.  It would take a man or a woman of genius
to find some use for this chitin.  Even identifying what sort of creature
produced it might prove a challenge.  Several depressions in the sand
exist here.  The largest of them is visible in the distance.  A typical
depression would be about a quarter of a mekillot in volume.  They appear
to have been caused by a giant fork sunk from the sky into the sand,
although even a child would see how ludicrous this explanation is.  They
are likely natural.  They are spaced far enough apart that it is not so
difficult to wind one's way between them, even with a pair of mounts.
Three or four of the dunes here have retaining walls built into them.
Judging by the make and condition of the bricks, they are somewhat
recent, built within several lifetimes ago.  They are too large to be
easily extricable from the sand.  This would probably require the aid of
half-giants, who might very well have been used in their construction.  To
discover these half-buried object's purpose here would depend upon a
serious excavation.

The Desert~
     The dunes on the sand plains below have gradually risen in height
as they reach this point.  Foothills lie below you.  You now stand on top
of a small, gently sloped mountain.  Reaching this point was difficult.
Conceivably, it would be possible to ascend deeper into the mountains.
This would require assistance from some of the land's greatest
mountaineers, as well as top-quality mountain climbing equipment.  Such
knowledge and gear is truly rare on Athas.  This land is partially
blocked by these taller mountains.  Without a more serious mountain
climbing expedition, heading back seems to be the only viable option.

The Desert~
     Far off to the west a chain of mountains breaks the illimitable tide of 
dunes.  Most persons who see them for the first time are disappointed.  If one 
expects mountains to look majestic, then these mountains appear more sand-
battered and unshapely.  Still, they have a certain charm to them, and they are a 
point of reference here in the desert.  To the north stretch dunes as far as the eye 
can see.

The Desert~
     While the inhabitants of most worlds would immediately recognize this area as 
a desert, those travelers more familiar with desert regions could probably note this as a 
particularly lush and verdant region, on the scale of such things.  Fruiting plants can be 
found here and there, most guarded by a colony of little stinging insects, whom 
pollinate the plants and protect them from herbivores.  A casual wanderer can only 
speculate on the toxicity of any of these fruits.
     Small basins, where rocks have collected at the bottom, punctuate the dunes 
here.  The vast majority of these rocks are crumbly sandstone.  A few of them appear to 
be more promising.

     The sand here is almost entirely barren of rocks.  While this is certainly true of 
much of Athas, the shortage of rock here seems more extreme.  One must dig for more 
than an arms length into the ground before finding even a pebble.

     The terrain here rises up every few meks into a sand-swelled dune, becoming 
somewhat angular near the top --- a sort of dune on top of a dune.  These sand 
formations stretch quite far, but not to the limits of visibility.

     In each direction the terrain rises in a gentle slope, marking this as the lowest 
point for some distance.  A sort of local minimum in the rolling topology of the 
desertscape, this bottom offers reasonable protection from the elements except during 
harsh storms.

     The ground descends  from several directions as it reaches this point.  From a tactical

     The soil here is dark and loamy.  Small burrowing insects exist here and there, 
and are more than willing to bite the fingers of anyone too curious about them.  
Certainly a passing hunter might wonder why the landscape doesn't have more plants 
than it does, but an experienced farmer might note how poorly aerated the soil is, and 
how erosion leaves the top layer exposed to the elements.

     The traveler through this region will note a considerable variety of cacti.  They 
grow in many forms and expressions, covering short and squat, round, sinewy, leafy 
and even tall enough to twice the height of a man.  Sadly, almost all of the cacti that 
grow here are covered in a thick layer of razor-sharp thorns.  Anyone unlucky enough to 
stumble into one could easily loose an eye, or have his or her skin cut to the bone.  
Getting any water out of one would take a lot of know-how.

The Desert~
     The traveler through this region will note a considerable variety of cacti.  They 
grow in many forms and expressions, covering short and squat, round, sinewy, leafy 
and even tall enough to twice the height of a man.  Sadly, almost all of the cacti that 
grow here are covered in a thick layer of razor-sharp thorns.  Anyone unlucky enough to 
stumble into one could easily loose an eye, or have his or her skin cut to the bone.  
Getting any water out of one would take a lot of know-how.
     A nearby wall of hills opens up onto a wide expanse of flat sand.  The occasional 
boulder doesn't do much to detract from the open and agoraphilic feeling lent to the 
sands here.

The Desert~
     Passage through this region is hampered by large, open pits of
tar.  The heat emanating from these pits is even worse than the heat off
of the sun.  Few animals seem willing to inhabit this area, for
understandable reasons.  A few large beasts can be seen struggling in the
tar pits.  Somehow they must have wandered in, or were chased.  They are
unable to escape, and are therefore trapped in a fate worse than death.

     Shrubs prick the surface of the land here, small hither and medium-sized 
thither.  One can imagine a herbivore experiencing disappointment as he peruses the 
different varieties, each brown and withered from sun exposure.  Indeed, the entire 
desertscape seems to be covered here by these dried plants, unless the passerby is lucky 
enough to pass through after a rainfall.  For a few days following a rainfall, the shrubs 
perk up and become brave enough to put forth leaves and seeds before they dry up 
again for weeks.

     The terrain here rises up every few meks into a sand-swelled dune, becoming 
somewhat angular near the top --- a sort of dune on top of a dune.  These sand 
formations stretch quite far, but not to the limits of visibility.

     The sand here is almost entirely barren of rocks.  While this is certainly true of 
much of Athas, the shortage of rock here seems more extreme.  One must dig for more 
than an arms length into the ground before finding even a pebble.

     The tops of some of the dunes here appear to be cloven or hewn through, 
probably ages ago.  This might be the remains of an ancient road.  Whether the road 
was neglected or deliberately destroyed can only be speculated upon.

     The sand here is gritty, too much so for comfort.  The grains are light enough to 
ride easily on any wind currents.  When the wind slows for a moment, it drops a thin 
layer of grit onto anyone unlucky enough to be traveling by.  Signs of life can be seen off 
in the distance, but plants seem stunted and reluctant to grow here, and animals unable 
to burrow.
     Small basins, where rocks have collected at the bottom, punctuate the dunes

     Thousands of nests can be seen about.  Eggshells are not in
evidence, leaving the passerby to wonder if the nests once belonged to
insects, marsupials, mammals, reptiles, repsupials or birds.  Each nest
is rather large, weighing almost as much as a man.  They are comprised of
bits of twig and grass, and are of sturdy construction.  One can only
wonder where the creatures who built these nests have gone.

     The air here is streaked by little convective currents of air.  Here they rise in a 
spiraling circular pattern from the ground, winding their way for a half a mek or so 
before they fade into the air.  They are easily visible because they kick up a fair amount 
of sand where they blow, and noteworthy because they have a pesky habit of dumping 
sand onto passersby.

     A huge crater punctures this area.  The crater extends for
several mekillot lengths even at its shortest dimension.  It is irregular
in shape.  Its general shape might be approximated if a few giant cookie
cutters were randomly punctured into the sand, over and over at the same
spot, lifting huge volumes of sand with each ascent.  The depth is about
three arms lengths at most places.  The sides are not steep, and easily
climbable.

     A nearby wall of hills opens up onto a wide expanse of flat sand.  The occasional 
boulder doesn't do much to detract from the open and agoraphilic feeling lent to the 
sands here.

     Small basins, where rocks have collected at the bottom, punctuate the dunes 
here.  The vast majority of these rocks are crumbly sandstone.  A few of them appear to 
be more promising.

     Every other dune or so here seems to have a couple of small
clouds of small insects hovering over it.  Upon inspection, these tiny
bugs are flit-scarabs, small bugs that look like a cross between a little
tiger-beetle and the familiar dung-beetle.  They chase each other around
in these clouds, dropping in small piles of about fifty or so to mate
voraciously with each other, before flying off far into the desert to
bear young.  No one knows why they choose here to congregate, except
perhaps for the small nervous lizards that sometimes come to prey on
them.

a dune.  These sand formations stretch quite far, but not to the limits

the rolling topology of the desertscape, this bottom offers reasonable
protection from the elements except during harsh storms.

attack from nearby high ground.  Softer sand piles in little dunes blown

     The soil here is dark and loamy.  Small burrowing insects exist here and there, 
and are more than willing to bite the fingers of anyone too curious about them.  
Certainly a passing hunter might wonder why the landscape doesn't have more plants 
than it does, but an experienced farmer might note how poorly aerated the soil is, and 
how erosion leaves the top layer exposed to the elements.  
     The terrain here rises up every few meks into a sand-swelled dune, becoming

     The traveler through this region will note a considerable variety of cacti.  They 
grow in many forms and expressions, covering short and squat, round, sinewy, leafy 
and even tall enough to twice the height of a man.  Sadly, almost all of the cacti that 
grow here are covered in a thick layer of razor-sharp thorns.  Anyone unlucky enough to 
stumble into one could easily loose an eye, or have his or her skin cut to the bone.  
Getting any water out of one would take a lot of know-how.

     The sand here is gritty, too much so for comfort.  The grains are light enough to 
ride easily on any wind currents.  When the wind slows for a moment, it drops a thin 
layer of grit onto anyone unlucky enough to be traveling by.  Signs of life can be seen off 
in the distance, but plants seem stunted and reluctant to grow here, and animals unable 
to burrow.
     The tops of some of the dunes here appear to be cloven or hewn through, 
probably ages ago.  This might be the remains of an ancient road.  Whether the road 
was neglected or deliberately destroyed can only be speculated upon.

     A long arm of dunes reaches out onto the terrain, which is otherwise flat.  The 
clustering of dunes is thick to the east, but thins out near the west where the arm of 
dunes curls into a fist.

The Desert~
     The ground here shows fewer signs of life than nearby terrain.  The plants yield 
little in the way of fluid save a few drops of unpalatable ichor that is unfit for drinking. 
Not much shade is available, and distant dunes appear tempting by comparison.  Tiny, 
uncatchable lizards fight over a few meager bones, leaving little enough for other 
scavengers.
     The sand here is almost entirely barren of rocks.  While this is certainly true of 
much of Athas, the shortage of rock here seems more extreme.  One must dig for more 
than an arms length into the ground before finding even a pebble.

     The terrain here rises up every few meks into a sand-swelled dune, becoming 
somewhat angular near the top --- a sort of dune on top of a dune.  These sand 
formations stretch quite far, but not to the limits of visibility.

The ground descends  from several directions as it reaches this point.  From a tactical 
standpoint, this would be a good spot to stage an attack from nearby high ground.  
Softer sand piles in little dunes blown from the top of nearby dunes.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     The fields continue in all directions.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     The fields continue in all directions.

Desert~
     This desert seems to go on forever, stretching across the landscape with
high and low dunes.  From here, if a traveler were to stand on the top of
a large dune and gaze to the southwest, they might detect the sight of a
large city to the southwest.  Most visible are the high, protective
yellow walls of the city.  Also on a clear day smoke from the cooking and
industrial fires rises up in a diffusing cloud above some quarters of the
city.

the protective walls of the city. Also, on a clear day smoke from the cooking and 
industrial fires rises up in a diffusing cloud above some quarters of the city.
     Here and here, one can spot clumps of honey-grass growing in the shade of a 
dune. The tough little stems have the most unrelenting grip on their roots. The root 
system itself sinks extensively into the dunes. Considering the trouble it takes for a 
handful of stems and their low nutritional value, honey-grass is not a serious food 
source. This is a shame considering their sweet, honey-like taste.
     Travel over these dunes can be quite quiet. The wind itself does not always 
make noise, especially on a hot day. Animals are few and far between, often preferring 
to remain in the shelter of their burrows. The sand absorbs footfalls. The quiet is a 
direct contrast to the noise of city-life.

high and low dunes.  From here, if a traveler were to stand on the top of
a large dune and gaze to the southwest, they might detect the sight of a
large city to the southwest.  Most visible are the high, protective
yellow walls of the city.  Also on a clear day smoke from the cooking and
industrial fires rises up in a diffusing cloud above some quarters of the
city.

The Desert~
     One particularly striking aspect of this stretch of dunes is that
they have a "U" shape.  It's not hard to spot the smaller, newer dunes
where they are formed of sand dumped by the prevailing winds.  More
localized air currents etch all the older dunes, each gust carrying a few
grains of sand away to deposit them perhaps elsewhere.  The "U" shape of
each dune faces almost invariably to the northeast.  The result of the
wind patterns here is that they leave the traveler almost continually
reminded of their sensation.  On the hottest days these winds are what
make this region bearable, save those gusts of air that have originated
on unspeakably hot regions of Athas.  The air moves across any measure of
exposed skin, usually a gentle caress.  The sand here is very low albedo,
absorbing most of the light that hits it rather than reflecting it.
During the day, this makes it especially merciful on the eyes in
comparison to surrounding regions.  Another property of the light
yellowish tone of the sand is that shadows show up well against it,
something somewhat distracting to stare at while the traveler walks or
rides on his way through the land.

The Desert~
     The result of the wind patterns here is that they leave the
traveler almost continually reminded of their sensation.  On the hottest
days these winds are what make this region bearable, save those gusts of
air that have originated on unspeakably hot regions of Athas.  The air
moves across any measure of exposed skin, usually a gentle caress.  The
sand here is very low albedo, absorbing most of the light that hits it
rather than reflecting it.  During the day, this makes it especially
merciful on the eyes in comparison to surrounding regions.  Another
property of the light yellowish tone of the sand is that shadows show up
well against it, something somewhat distracting to stare at while the
traveler walks or rides on his way through the land.  The odor of the
land here seems to remind the traveler of the scent of the dracunculus
herb, commonly known as tarragon.  This impression is deceptive, as
tarragon does not grow for many mek lengths of this spot.  As scents
often do, it has the potential to awaken memories and associations,
especially in those who are familiar with cooking.

that is often found poking out from any spot of shade is nihuaxan grass.
These grasses grow in clumps that are about a third of an arms length in
diameter.  They are perhaps able to out compete other plants because of
their ability to survive long dry spells.  Herbivores often ignore it,
despite it's tolerable taste, because of its low nutritional value.  Even
when dried, the stems have a habit of standing up against the wind.

The Desert~
     The odor of the land here seems to remind the traveler of the
scent of the dracunculus herb, commonly known as tarragon.  This
impression is deceptive, as tarragon does not grow for many mek lengths
of this spot.  As scents often do, it has the potential to awaken
memories and associations, especially in those who are familiar with
cooking.  One sort of plant that is often found poking out from any spot
of shade is nihuaxan grass.  These grasses grow in clumps that are about
a third of an arms length in diameter.  They are perhaps able to out
compete other plants because of their ability to survive long dry spells.
Herbivores often ignore it, despite it's tolerable taste, because of its
low nutritional value.  Even when dried, the stems have a habit of
standing up against the wind.  The dunes around this point grow in
distinctive patterns of three.  One large dune will be flanked by two
smaller sand hills.  Anyone curious enough to investigate further might
be puzzled by the fact that dunes seem to be comprised by the same
quality of sand.  Perhaps a sage or an old elf might fathom an
explanation.

This is in direct contrast to most of Athas, which is very clear in
comparison.  Although it might seem at first unlikely that there would be
any significant concentration of vapors in the air here that would lend
it such a tint, this possibility should not be discounted considering the
variety of desert animals, plants and beasts that make this land home.
The local superstition holds the sky to be forever tinged by the ravages
of the mage-wars of old.

have adapted to desert life, and therefore usually grow a few arms
beneath the sands, safe from the ravages of the sun and the winds.  The
land rises at a few points to a low ridge.  Although experienced
travelers might expect a ridge to be firmly protected by rocks, this
ridge is perhaps disappointingly comprised of a fine dust.  By
consequence, the formation is rapidly being eroded by sandstorms, and the
dust can be seen deposited here and there across the dunes.

Within a River of Sand~
     The sky over the land here has a light orange haze to it.  This
is in direct contrast to most of Athas, which is very clear in
comparison.  Although it might seem at first unlikely that there would be
any significant concentration of vapors in the air here that would lend
it such a tint, this possibility should not be discounted considering the
variety of desert animals, plants and beasts that make this land home.
The local superstition holds the sky to be forever tinged by the ravages
of the mage-wars of old.  The air is laced with the scent of

the at one time metamorphic rocks were worn down to create this sand.

The Desert~
     The land rises at a few points to a low ridge.  Although
experienced travelers might expect a ridge to be firmly protected by
rocks, this ridge is perhaps disappointingly comprised of a fine dust.  By
consequence, the formation is rapidly being eroded by sandstorms, and the
dust can be seen deposited here and there across the dunes.  These dunes
here are evidently used by wild erdlus sometimes for nesting purposes.
Broken twigs and grass clusters provide some testimony to this.  A better
indicator is the frequency of torn down feathers that blow here and
there, elusively dragged away by the wind.  If one of these fragments is
accidentally breathed in, it tickles the throat.  The sand here looks
orange, with just a hint of pink to it.  The reason for this becomes
clear upon closer inspection.  Any given handful of sand is in fact
comprised of a variety of different sand particles, some of red, white
and others of orange.  This seems to suggest to a trained observer that
the at one time metamorphic rocks were worn down to create this sand.

Within a River of Sand~
     The sky over the land here has a light orange haze to it.  This
is in direct contrast to most of Athas, which is very clear in
comparison.  Although it might seem at first unlikely that there would be
any significant concentration of vapors in the air here that would lend
it such a tint, this possibility should not be discounted considering the
variety of desert animals, plants and beasts that make this land home.
The local superstition holds the sky to be forever tinged by the ravages
of the mage-wars of old.  The air is laced with the scent of
Tzitzloch-mangoes.  These frustrating plants are a tease upon the senses
of men and elves, offering a rich perfume but difficult to locate.  They
have adapted to desert life, and therefore usually grow a few arms
beneath the sands, safe from the ravages of the sun and the winds.  The
land rises at a few points to a low ridge.  Although experienced
travelers might expect a ridge to be firmly protected by rocks, this
ridge is perhaps disappointingly comprised of a fine dust.  By
consequence, the formation is rapidly being eroded by sandstorms, and the

of these cries are no doubt the hunting calls of falcons, be they wild or
domesticated.  They can make a quick meal of a young erdlu who is not
well protected by its parents.  Far more common than falcon cries are the
sounds of buzzards.  Alone, a buzzard is no threat to anyone, but in huge
flocks they will take down a weak animal in seconds.  Birds are hard to
spot in the sky because of the sun glare during the day, or because of
the darkness at night.  Sound does not carry well.  One thing is for
sure, where one can hear the calls of birds they must be close.

The Desert~
     The sand here looks orange, with just a hint of pink to it.  The
reason for this becomes clear upon of sand is in fact comprised of a
variety of different sand particles, some of red, white and others of
orange.  This seems to suggest to a trained observer that the at one time
metamorphic rocks were worn down to create this sand.  The sound of birds
of flight can occasionally be detected.  Some of these cries are no doubt
the hunting calls of falcons, be they wild or domesticated.  They can
make a quick meal of a young erdlu who is not well protected by its
parents.  Far more common than falcon cries are the sounds of buzzards.
Alone, a buzzard is no threat to anyone, but in huge flocks they will
take down a weak animal in seconds.  Birds are hard to spot in the sky
because of the sun glare during the day, or because of the darkness at
night.  Sound does not carry well.  One thing is for sure, where one can
hear the calls of birds they must be close.  Here and there can be found
a dried bit of cactus rind.  This is an ironic find for most thirsty
travelers, because at one point in time the cactus must have contained a
good bit of water.  This whole area is a clear result of overgrazing.
Very little in the way of edible plant matter remains.  Even the cactus

the throat and provoke tremendous coughing fits.

The Desert~
     Here and there can be found a dried bit of cactus rind.  This is
an ironic find for most thirsty travelers, because at one point in time
the cactus must have contained a good bit of water.  This whole area is a
clear result of overgrazing.  Very little in the way of edible plant
matter remains.  Even the cactus rinds seem to be heavily chewed.  One
form of life that seems to have some success in these sands is the
draught-mold.  Draught- mold colonies themselves are hard to spot,
growing only where they can find wet dead tissue to infect.  Since this
is rare, the draught-mold colonies suffice to shoot up cloud after cloud
of nearly invisible draught-mold spores.  Most humans and elves are
allergic to these, as they irritate the throat and provoke tremendous
coughing fits.  Nearby are several rock formations.  Upon inspection,
these turn out to be little more than clumps of sandstone.  They stand
about man height.  They are not incredibly substantial, and crumble
easily when handled too roughly.  A stone mason might lament that they
are not sturdier, else they might make passable building materials.

largest of them is visible in the distance.  A typical depression would
be about a quarter of a mekillot in volume.  They appear to have been
caused by a giant fork sunk from the sky into the sand, although even a
child would see how ludicrous this explanation is.  They are likely
natural.  They are spaced far enough apart that it is not so difficult to
wind one's way between them, even with a pair of mounts.

The Desert~
     The wind here is not as constant as in other regions.  When it
does blow, it is prone to strong gusts.  A curious moaning sound
accompanies each gust.  This might be mistaken for the call of a giant.
More likely, it is air being forced through a rock formation.  The
vibrations from this can sometimes produce a moaning sound.  The ground
here is littered with scraps of papery chitin debris.  They crunch
underfoot if stepped on too sharply, otherwise they feel soft against the
skin when handled.  It would take a man or a woman of genius to find some
use for this chitin.  Even identifying what sort of creature produced it
might prove a challenge.  Several depressions in the sand exist here.  The

Three or four of the dunes here have retaining walls built into them.
Judging by the make and condition of the bricks, they are somewhat
recent, built within several lifetimes ago.  They are too large to be
easily extricable from the sand.  This would probably require the aid of
half-giants, who might very well have been used in their construction.  To
discover these half-buried object's purpose here would depend upon a
serious excavation.

here have retaining walls built into them.  Judging by the make and
condition of the bricks, they are somewhat recent, built within several
lifetimes ago.  They are too large to be easily extricable from the sand.
This would probably require the aid of half-giants, who might very well
have been used in their construction.  To discover these half-buried
object's purpose here would depend upon a serious excavation.  Every few
boot-falls or so an unwary traveler may be greeted by a loud cracking
sound.  This is caused by pop-nettles.  The seed-pods have a tendency to
explode gently when tread upon.  This scares most herbivores,
discouraging them from attempting to eat or walk on the plants.  The
seed-pods will deflate within minutes of separation from the stem,
loosing their pop.  They often prevent stealthy travel through this
region.

     Several depressions in the sand exist here.  The largest of them
is visible in the distance.  A typical depression would be about a
quarter of a mekillot in volume.  They appear to have been caused by a
giant fork sunk from the sky into the sand, although even a child would
see how ludicrous this explanation is.  They are likely natural.  They

pleasant.

The Desert~
     Every few boot-falls or so an unwary traveler may be greeted by a
loud cracking sound.  This is caused by pop-nettles.  The seed-pods have
a tendency to explode gently when tread upon.  This scares most
herbivores, discouraging them from attempting to eat or walk on the
plants.  The seed-pods will deflate within minutes of separation from the
stem, loosing their pop.  They often prevent stealthy travel through this
region.  A particularly large dune is visible off in the distance.  It is
larger in size even than a mekillot.  During most of the day, this dune
casts a respectable shadow.  Dunes of this mass are large enough to
affect the formation of nearby dunes, as can be seen here.  The
properties of the sand in this dune become apparent as one grows closer,
distinct from the sand in other dunes.  The sand here seems to transport
heat pretty well, giving it a cool feeling against the skin under most
circumstances.  The grains have been filed down over the years, leaving
them roundish and soft against the skin.  Even just a fraction of an
arm's length below the surface, the sand is cool would be almost

by the men and women of the desert as an ill-omen.  These people

The Desert~
     The sand here seems to transport heat pretty well, giving it a
cool feeling against the skin under most circumstances.  The grains have
been filed down over the years, leaving them roundish and soft against
the skin.  Even just a fraction of an arm's length below the surface, the
sand is cool would be almost pleasant.  The occasional cloud leaves a
shadow against the surface of the sand.  The clouds do not tarry long
enough in the journey across the sky to offer much real or lasting shade.

would be a familiar item to many Athasians, who could view a skull as an
art material or something useful in building a tool.  Drajians might
especially take a skull as a good omen.

gently against the skin of anyone walking past.  Elven rumors repute
parts of the grass to be edible, however it would take a brave man or
woman to trust his health to an elven rumor.  Kanks have been known to
chew the brown stems if they are starving.  Sadly, the gith-grass is not
strong enough to be women into a sturdy basket.  Some of the dunes here
crop together in memorable formations.  When viewed at dawn or at dusk,
these formations can sometimes have the visual aspect of a giant animal
skull.  Although this might seem a grim association for some, a skull
would be a familiar item to many Athasians, who could view a skull as an
art material or something useful in building a tool.  Drajians might
especially take a skull as a good omen.

The Desert~
     The further the traveler strays from the road, the more they
become struck by a characteristic smell.  The ground here is somewhat
loamy, and good soil is rare enough on Athas as to offer a memorable
scent to the beholder.  Any person curious enough to dig into the ground
a little will recognize the reason that plant life here is not so
abundant.  Especially if they are familiar with agriculture, an explorer
will note an infestation of Axliticaca-worms in the soil.  These
finger-long, pesky worms seem harmless enough.  They are however
inedible, and chew the roots of any plant they run into.  One species of
plant life that is resilient enough to sprout up here is gith-grass.  The

Fresh breezes seem to help some, as breathing through one's mouth.  It's
conceivable that a team of giant's could dig far enough down to discover
the source of the stench, but convincing them that this is a good idea
would take some doing.

the peak of a dune.  Some of these ridges trail down outside of the dune,
projecting through the surface for a half of a mekillot length or so.  The
rock appears to be volcanic.  Traces of dissolved minerals have
precipitated sporadically throughout the rock.  This rock is fairly
solid.  Finding a free pebble for a souvenir is no easy task.

visual aspect of a giant animal skull.  Although this might seem a grim
association for some, a skull would be a familiar item to many Athasians,
who could view a skull as an art material or something useful in building
a tool.  Drajians might especially take a skull as a good omen.  The sky
sometimes appears to glitter faintly during the day.  This is the result
of the prevailing winds, which can carry a few tons of sand across the
sky every day, a few grains at a time.  When light refracts off of some
of the more transparent grains, the sky will momentarily appear to
glitter.  Pretty at first, one gets used to it after a while.  The air
here has the stink of a latrine.  It is quite foul.  The source seems to
be the sand itself, or more probably something buried deep in the sand.
Fresh breezes seem to help some, as breathing through one's mouth.  It's
conceivable that a team of giant's could dig far enough down to discover
the source of the stench, but convincing them that this is a good idea
would take some doing.

they jump out at the unwary passerby.  Each one sucks only a drop of

of rock splits the peak of a dune.  Some of these ridges trail down
outside of the dune, projecting through the surface for a half of a
mekillot length or so.  The rock appears to be volcanic.  Traces of
dissolved minerals have precipitated sporadically throughout the rock.
This rock is fairly solid.  Finding a free pebble for a souvenir is no
easy task.  Any human or dwarf whom dallies too long near this spot will
soon feel the wrath of the tiny, nearly minuscule sand fleas.  They lie
dormant under the sand for years, waiting to hear vibrations.  At last
they jump out at the unwary passerby.  Each one sucks only a drop of
blood before dropping off, leaving an itchy red bump behind.

The Desert~
     The air here has the stink of a latrine.  It is quite foul.  The
source seems to be the sand itself, or more probably something buried
deep in the sand.  Fresh breezes seem to help some, as breathing through
one's mouth.  It's conceivable that a team of giant's could dig far
enough down to discover the source of the stench, but convincing them
that this is a good idea would take some doing.  Here and there a ridge

the surface here is mostly orange.  Underneath this thin layer is a much
broader layer of yellowish sand.  The yellowed particles are smaller than
the orange ones, causing them to sink down beneath them given time.
Footprints are an easily recognizable by their color difference.  One
property of the sand here has given it the name, "pillow-sand," by the
desert folk of the region.  This sand seems to swallow sound, especially
the sound of footfalls.  It is pretty much the opposite of drum-sand.  The
long patches of pillow-sand make this area a favorite camping point for
raiders.

Lonely Wasteland~
     Any human or dwarf whom dallies too long near this spot will soon
feel the wrath of the tiny, nearly minuscule sand fleas.  They lie
dormant under the sand for years, waiting to hear vibrations.  At last

small patch of cacti.  Most of them seem to be of one or two
fleshy-leafed species.  The sap of this cactus is a skin irritant.  Any
fool dumb enough to get any in his eyes is in for a particularly
miserable week.  Over time, the sap looses much of its potency when
separated from the plant.

corpse of a shrewallaby.  Herds of these small mamsupials will make their
burrows under the dunes here.  None of these borrows are presently
visible.  When a predator finds their lair, they are forced to flee,
leaving the elderly and the slow to be caught by the interloper.  Some
voracious predator must have taken down a few of the shrewallabies.  There
is not much left except a few chunks of hide.  These chunks are leathery
and low in nutritional value.  When roasted, they can be safely chewed
and release a very pleasant flavor.

fool dumb enough to get any in his eyes is in for a particularly
miserable week.  Over time, the sap looses much of its potency when
separated from the plant.  Here and there can be found the gnawed-over
corpse of a shrewallaby.  Herds of these small mamsupials will make their
burrows under the dunes here.  None of these borrows are presently
visible.  When a predator finds their lair, they are forced to flee,
leaving the elderly and the slow to be caught by the interloper.  Some
voracious predator must have taken down a few of the shrewallabies.  There
is not much left except a few chunks of hide.  These chunks are leathery
and low in nutritional value.  When roasted, they can be safely chewed
and release a very pleasant flavor.

The Desert~
     The sand near the surface here is mostly orange.  Underneath this
thin layer is a much broader layer of yellowish sand.  The yellowed
particles are smaller than the orange ones, causing them to sink down
beneath them given time.  Footprints are an easily recognizable by their
color difference.  One property of the sand here has given it the name,
"pillow-sand," by the desert folk of the region.  This sand seems to
swallow sound, especially the sound of footfalls.  It is pretty much the
opposite of drum-sand.  The long patches of pillow-sand make this area a
favorite camping point for raiders.  The terrain here is favorable to a
small patch of cacti.  Most of them seem to be of one or two
fleshy-leafed species.  The sap of this cactus is a skin irritant.  Any
fool dumb enough to get any in his eyes is in for a particularly
miserable week.  Over time, the sap looses much of its potency when
separated from the plant.

Storm-Scourged Waste~
     Every few boot-falls or so an unwary traveler may be greeted by a
loud cracking sound.  This is caused by pop-nettles.  The seed-pods have
a tendency to explode gently when tread upon.  This scares most
herbivores, discouraging them from attempting to eat or walk on the
plants.  The seed-pods will deflate within minutes of separation from the
stem, loosing their pop.  They often prevent stealthy travel through this
region.  A particularly large dune is visible off in the distance.  It is
larger in size even than a mekillot.  During most of the day, this dune
casts a respectable shadow.  Dunes of this mass are large enough to
affect the formation of nearby dunes, as can be seen here.  The
properties of the sand in this dune become apparent as one grows closer,
distinct from the sand in other dunes.  The sand here seems to transport
heat pretty well, giving it a cool feeling against the skin under most
circumstances.  The grains have been filed down over the years, leaving
them roundish and soft against the skin.  Even just a fraction of an
arm's length below the surface, the sand is cool would be almost
pleasant.

The Desert~
     The sky over the land here has a light orange haze to it.  This
is in direct contrast to most of Athas, which is very clear in
comparison.  Although it might seem at first unlikely that there would be
any significant concentration of vapors in the air here that would lend
it such a tint, this possibility should not be discounted considering the
variety of desert animals, plants and beasts that make this land home.
The local superstition holds the sky to be forever tinged by the ravages
of the mage-wars of old.  The air is laced with the scent of
Tzitzloch-mangoes.  These frustrating plants are a tease upon the senses
of men and elves, offering a rich perfume but difficult to locate.  They
have adapted to desert life, and therefore usually grow a few arms
beneath the sands, safe from the ravages of the sun and the winds.  The
land rises at a few points to a low ridge.  Although experienced
travelers might expect a ridge to be firmly protected by rocks, this
ridge is perhaps disappointingly comprised of a fine dust.  By
consequence, the formation is rapidly being eroded by sandstorms, and the
dust can be seen deposited here and there across the dunes.

careless passerby to stub their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a
sling-missile or a building material.  In some spots these recently rocks
seem to be recently formed from the pressure of overlying sand, and lie
exposed where the wind blows the top layer away.

the top layer away.  Shallow depressions dot the landscape.  They are
arranged in clusters of about seven or eight.  Their slopes are gentle.
The deepest of them is little more than a man's height.  According to
local legend, they appeared a few decades ago after a bitter contest
between two rival sorcerers.  If this is to be believed, deep notches
were blasted into the earth with the result of stray spells.  With time,
only these shallow depressions are left.  More arguably, they are the
result of some natural phenomenon.

sandstone is that they are dense enough for a careless passerby to stub
their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a sling-missile or a building

the top layer away.  Shallow depressions dot the landscape.  They are
arranged in clusters of about seven or eight.  Their slopes are gentle.
The deepest of them is little more than a man's height.  According to
local legend, they appeared a few decades ago after a bitter contest
between two rival sorcerers.  If this is to be believed, deep notches
were blasted into the earth with the result of stray spells.  With time,
only these shallow depressions are left.  More arguably, they are the
result of some natural phenomenon.

The Desert~
     Here and there can be found the gnawed-over corpse of a
shrewallaby.  Herds of these small mamsupials will make their burrows
under the dunes here.  None of these borrows are presently visible.  When
a predator finds their lair, they are forced to flee, leaving the elderly
and the slow to be caught by the interloper.  Some voracious predator
must have taken down a few of the shrewallabies.  There is not much left
except a few chunks of hide.  These chunks are leathery and low in
nutritional value.  When roasted, they can be safely chewed and release a
very pleasant flavor.  Not far beneath the surface of the sand here are

determined.  What they would do next with a few old bricks would be hard

The Desert~
     The terrain here is favorable to a small patch of cacti.  Most of
them seem to be of one or two fleshy-leafed species.  The sap of this
cactus is a skin irritant.  Any fool dumb enough to get any in his eyes
is in for a particularly miserable week.  Over time, the sap looses much
of its potency when separated from the plant.  Here and there can be
found the gnawed-over corpse of a shrewallaby.  Herds of these small
mamsupials will make their burrows under the dunes here.  None of these
borrows are presently visible.  When a predator finds their lair, they
are forced to flee, leaving the elderly and the slow to be caught by the
interloper.  Some voracious predator must have taken down a few of the
shrewallabies.  There is not much left except a few chunks of hide.  These
chunks are leathery and low in nutritional value.  When roasted, they can
be safely chewed and release a very pleasant flavor.  Not far beneath the
surface of the sand here are large chunks of sandstone.  The frustrating
thing about these chunks of sandstone is that they are dense enough for a
careless passerby to stub their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a
sling-missile or a building material.  In some spots these recently rocks
seem to be recently formed from the pressure of overlying sand, and lie
exposed where the wind blows the top layer away.

must have taken down a few of the shrewallabies.  There is not much left

sandstone is that they are dense enough for a careless passerby to stub
their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a sling-missile or a building
material.  In some spots these recently rocks seem to be recently formed

only these shallow depressions are left.  More arguably, they are the
result of some natural phenomenon.

The Desert~
     The terrain here is favorable to a small patch of cacti.  Most of
them seem to be of one or two fleshy-leafed species.  The sap of this
cactus is a skin irritant.  Any fool dumb enough to get any in his eyes
is in for a particularly miserable week.  Over time, the sap looses much
of its potency when separated from the plant.  Here and there can be
found the gnawed-over corpse of a shrewallaby.  Herds of these small
mamsupials will make their burrows under the dunes here.  None of these
borrows are presently visible.  When a predator finds their lair, they
are forced to flee, leaving the elderly and the slow to be caught by the
interloper.  Some voracious predator must have taken down a few of the
shrewallabies.  There is not much left except a few chunks of hide.  These
chunks are leathery and low in nutritional value.  When roasted, they can
be safely chewed and release a very pleasant flavor.  Not far beneath the
surface of the sand here are large chunks of sandstone.  The frustrating
thing about these chunks of sandstone is that they are dense enough for a
careless passerby to stub their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a
sling-missile or a building material.  In some spots these recently rocks
seem to be recently formed from the pressure of overlying sand, and lie
exposed where the wind blows the top layer away.

borrows are presently visible.  When a predator finds their lair, they
are forced to flee, leaving the elderly and the slow to be caught by the
interloper.  Some voracious predator must have taken down a few of the
shrewallabies.  There is not much left except a few chunks of hide.  These
chunks are leathery and low in nutritional value.  When roasted, they can
be safely chewed and release a very pleasant flavor.  Not far beneath the
surface of the sand here are large chunks of sandstone.  The frustrating
thing about these chunks of sandstone is that they are dense enough for a
careless passerby to stub their toes on, but too crumbly too work as a
sling-missile or a building material.  In some spots these recently rocks
seem to be recently formed from the pressure of overlying sand, and lie
exposed where the wind blows the top layer away.

North of a Road~
     To the south runs the course of a well-kept road.  To the east can 
be seen the high walls of a city.  Mountains rise to the north.  Teams of 
slaves are sometimes seen to tread the sands under the watchful eye of a 
slave-master.  Patrols of soldiers march over the dunes.  Pieces of rubbish 
litter the sands, and useable materials are scarce.  
Mountains lie to the North.

The Desert~
     The dunes on the sand plains below have gradually risen in height
as they reach this point.  Foothills lie below you.  You now stand on top
of a small, gently sloped mountain.  Reaching this point was difficult.
Conceivably, it would be possible to ascend deeper into the mountains.
This would require assistance from some of the land's greatest
mountaineers, as well as top-quality mountain climbing equipment.  Such
knowledge and gear is truly rare on Athas.  This land is partially
blocked by these taller mountains.  Without a more serious mountain
climbing expedition, heading back seems to be the only viable option.

Inside a Cave~
     The interior of this cave is usually cooler than the outside desert, although 
always at a comfortable temperature.  The surrounded rock and sand insulates it from 
the winds, storms and temperature extrema.  
The signs of animal passage are unmistakable in the dirt that lines the cave floor.  It 
would take an experienced tracker to sort them out sufficiently.  Tiny bits of gnawed 
bone, discarded eggshell, and animal nest bedding exist in disarray decorate the 
surroundings.  Primitive scratch marks  line one of the cave walls.  They could be 
humanoid-made, or the work of some intelligent or desperate beast.

The Interior of a Cave~
     The interior of this cave has a low ceiling.  Neither 
stalactite nor stalagmite decorates its surface.  There is just 
enough room in here for an inix, provided the beast is willing to 
scurry in on its belly.  Few signs of long term habitation are in 
evidence, although one should certainly not let this put them at 
ease.

In a Field of Dunes~
     A road can be seen in the distance, curving from the west 
down towards the south.  Towards the southeast, a small chain of 
mountains dares the desert.  Towards the north is dunes as far as 
the eye can see.  The Sea of Eternal Dust threatens to erode 
what's left of humanoidkind civilization from the face of Athas.  
A huge crater opens up to the southwest.

Fields of Urik~
     The fields of Urik are tilled seasonally by burly Urikite farmers.
Yellow-clad soldiers can be seen patrolling day and night as the crops
and grains are tended to.  The lifeblood of the massive city-state of
Urik lies with their food source, which is also a form of currency in
some areas, where food doesn't grow at all.  It is rumored that the
farmlands of Urik took the sorcerer-king Hamanu two thousand years to
grow and till to what they are today.
     To the south and east, an ancient stone road cuts through the fields.

Sandy Plain~
     The loose sands here create more of a flat plain then dunes.  A
sanguine-red in color the soil is burnt and destroyed.  There appears to
be no life in these parts of Athas.
     To the north the ancient stone blocks of a large road can be seen.

Within a River of Sand~
     A great crater lies directly to the south.  The bottom lies many, 
many mekillot lengths down.  So far down is it, that it's hard to get a good 
look at the bottom.  Legend has it that water is to be found at the bottom, 
although other rumors disagree.  No credible report exists of anyone 
climbing to the bottom, so steep are the sides.

Within a River of Sand~
     Mountains rise up far to the west in long chain.  The tops are 
rounded, and show white-caps.  A well-constructed road is to the north, 
although at this point a picky observer could point out obvious signs of 
neglect.  Here and there trash lies in piles from travelers, and from road 
crews.
