human soldier man jaguar~
a three-feathered soldier~
A soldier wearing a headdress of three feathers stands here vigilantly.
~
This man exhibits the typical weathering effects of Athas in full force: burnt,
darkened skin, countless scars and scrapes, wind-tousled hair.  Additionally,
a small runic tattoo, the city's abstraction of a jaguar, has been inked onto
his forehead, signifying him as a soldier.  The hardened muscles and bulky
frame are congruent with one who has spent countless hours in a training yard
or endless weeks patrolling the streets.

the burly, steel-haired merchant~
The burly, steel-haired merchant bustles about here.
~
This aging man is all tanned flesh, toned muscle, and taut sinew.  A
number of pale, long since healed scars decorate his skin, creating a
symphony of a well-lived life.  Shortly cropped, steel-grey hair adorns
his head, complemented strongly by bushy white eyebrows and an thick,
masculine moustache.  He stands no more than six arms tall from toe to
head, though his burly stature makes him seem shorter, despite his
overbearing presence.

new newmob~
the aging, scar adorned half-elf~
An aging, scar-adorned half-elf moves about the room, attending to customers.
~
The only thing average about this elderly half-elf is her height.
Besides that, every inch of her body is covered in pale scars, some
appearing to have been caused by various weapons, while others look like
bite marks.  Thin, peppered hair is tied back with a leather thong, and
sits beneath a headdress of black hemp decorated with countless feathers
of dozens of colors and hues.  The old half-breed's eyes fail to be
overshadowed by the feathers, however, as their vibrant amber hue seem to
burn like the sun with youthful vigor.  This haleness of body continues
down through her frame, which is no less than tightly corded muscles
supported by relatively thin limbs.

the portly, scruffy-bearded dwarf~
A portly, scruffy bearded dwarf is sitting at the bar, drink in hand.
~
The dwarf before you is built rather like an obsidian statue.  Thick,
burly limbs support an equally stringent musculature, one that shows
itself through leathery, sun-darkened skin.  Atop his bald head, the
dwarf sports a woven headdress of brown leather, which supports six
bright feathers clumped in a group.

the svelte, stoic-browed woman human~
A svelte, stoic-browed merchant is here, helping with customers.
~
A svelte, well-built woman approaching the middle-years of the human
lifespan is here before you.  Here steely-grey eyes combine with her
emotionless brow to project a stoic disposition that is difficult to
read.  Jet black hair has been braided into a number of tight cords and
tied back with a leather thong beneath a multi-feathered headdress.  She
stands in the lower range of human female height, perhaps just under five
arms high, though the slender musculature she possesses affords her quite
a bit more presence than her height alone would suggest.

has been died a night black hue.  Vibrant slashes of bright orange cloth
lie generously interspersed over the black, the contrast drawing much
attention to the entire piece.  A loose hood surrounds the shoulders,
allowing it to be draped over the wearer's upper back, or drawn up to
hide his features.  A number of stylized runes depicting the two moons
Ral and Guthay have been sewn into the black of the robe with bright
orange thread, marking it to be the garb of a local priest.

The black column is polished to a gentle shine and displays intricate
carvings of vicious jaguars devouring their helpless prey, as well as a

with hard agafari benches and serves as a waiting area for those wishing

The Training Hall Entrance~
     This wide hallway heads north into the main training grounds, and
south into Ral Temple's main corridor.  This section of the temple also
serves as a gathering place for knights and templars about to leave on
specific tasks.  The ground is covered with thick agafari floor boards
which, like most of the temple, get used often.  The walls are dark grey
stone, and are barely less-scratched than the floor they sit upon.  There
are a number of wall hangings made from pulped agafari sawdust.  The
paintings on them are crude and colorless, but they portray the general
battle-hungry attitude of the people who occupy this hall.

     This noisy hall is filled with long wooden tables, and houses
scores of noisy knights.  The floor, walls, and tables are all stained
from food-spillage, though it appears that some effort has been put to
cleaning them.  To the north end of the rectangular hall is a servery,
where the occupants of the hall can go and fetch their meals.  Behind the
servery is an equally noisy kitchen, from which floats strong odors of
cooking flesh.

A Black-Tiled Hallway~
     This hallway outlines the first floor of the Ral Temple.  The
floors are tiled with polished obsidian squares, though they have been
scuffed by the boots of many templars and knights.  Along the mostly
white walls hang various painting, wall-hangings, and tapestries
depicting everything from sleeping jaguars to harsh battle carnage.

A Room With A Spiraled Staircase~
     This landing consists of a plain, cube-shaped room with a spiral
staircase at the center.  The stairs are made from stacked obsidian slabs
with an agafari hand railing along the outside edge.  The stairs lead to
the second tier of the Ral Temple, while the western exit leads to the
ground floor.

A Room With A Spiraled Staircase~
     This room leads either back down the obsidian-stepped staircase
or west into the second tier of the Ral Temple.  To the west peeks a
white-tiled hallway that is significantly more aesthetically pleasing
than the one below it.  Though this floor shows signs of wear, it is well
maintained.  There are large obsidian pillars set into the walls at the
four corners that run from the top of the temple to the bottom floor that
help support the massive stone room.  They are etched with faint carvings
of moons, jaguars, and feathers, and are roughly themed around battle and
conquest.

     This small alcove, attached to the larger tent to the east, holds
a dark, haunting quality.  A small, circular table wrought from a solid
piece of black stone sits in the middle of the alcove, its center of the
housing the casing for a small lamp.  Around the perimeter of the table,
twenty four small, angular runes have been carved deep into the surface
of the stone, each no larger perhaps than two human thumbs.  Two squat
stools, each with a long white hempcloth cover draped over it, are drawn
up to the table.  On the far side from the flap of the alcove, there is a
small, shell-banded chest with a thick obsidian lock set well into the
wood.  The sparse nature of the alcove couples with the flickering lamp
light to create menacing, dancing shadows upon the walls.

criss-crossed hardwood planks that appear to have been sanded and buffed
recently.  Between each pair of doors, a torch is attached to the wall,
projecting pockets of light down the corridor.  At the end, a window
looks out and barely pokes over the wall of Two Moon city and into the
commons of Draj.  Directly below, the window shows the twenty foot gap

to supply liquid to the occupants of the chairs during extended meetings.
The top of the table displays a large carving of Athas' two moons, the
smaller of which is silver while the larger is dull yellow.  The
surrounding wall is painted a dull beige and to prevent distraction
during intense conversations and battles of wit, it contains no excessive
ornamentation.

dark blue cloth and set with good quality obsidian dinnerware.  Various
potted plants of different sizes sit both in the corners, and along the
walls.  there is a fountain in the middle of the hall, where a wench
periodically goes to fill a pitcher of water.

place.  Rather, members of the army and templarate come here to equip
themselves with implements of war.

     Set apart from the rest of the Snarling Jaguar, this room is
quite a bit more quiet.  The walls are lined with squat, lightly padded
couches, many of which are occupied by quietly conversing patrons.  The
pungent smell of pulque is heavy on the air, and nearly drowns out the
scent of marinated erdlu and roasted peppers.  At any given time, two or
three slaves move through the room, taking orders and serving drinks to
the patrons.

The Snarling Jaguar~
     It would appear that the owner of this establishment has made it
a point to remind the customers that in Draj, the way of the warrior is
supreme.  The walls are covered in paintings of warriors, depicting many
glorious battles, either with two warriors facing one another, or some
warrior slaying a wild beast.  The awning that surrounds the upper rim of
the room is trimmed with a row of sun-bleached white skulls, no doubt the
victims of some great warrior's victories.  On the west side of the room,
a long bar of stained agafari rises several arms from the ground with a
number of stools lining its perimeter.  Elsewhere, the room is filled
with squat tables and stools, many of them filled by Draji and foreign
customers alike.  A number of servers, each bearing a simple leather
headdress with no further decoration, move about through the pub, taking
orders and brining food and drink to the patrons.

A Tailor's Workshop~
     This small workshop is cluttered with lengths of leather, nails,
tools, wood, chitin plates, and chords of giant hair.  A small workbench
sits in the middle of the room and serves as more of an appraisal
apparatus rather than a real tool.  There is a door leading to a much
larger workroom to the back, though it appears to be off limits to the
patrons of this workshop.

A Black-Tiled Hallway~
     This hallway outlines the first floor of the Ral Temple.  The
floors are tiled with polished obsidian squares, though they have been
scuffed by the boots of many templars and knights.  Along the mostly
white walls hang various painting, wall-hangings, and tapestries
depicting everything from sleeping jaguars to harsh battle carnage.

An Entryway~
     This broad hallway is plainly designed, with no frills on the
walls and pillars that outline the area.  The ground is roughly scuffed
from an excessive amount of troops moving through here.  On the western
wall, there is a large plaque with a stylistic depiction of a jaguar
ripping its prey to shreds - the generic symbol for the army of Draj.  A
faint odor of sweat clings to the area, though it is barely noticeable.
       To the south, the hallway opens into a large room intended for
conferences.  To the north, the hallway continues deeper into the temple.

A Rectangular Conference Room~
     This domed room serves as a meeting place for high-ranking
members of the Draji armed forces and their acquantainces.  The fairly
spartan hall is adorned with little, save for a two-moons plaque on the
west wall, which is painted grey.  A dark blue stripe, about a foot wide,
has been painted at the top of the wall to break the line where the wall
meets the ceiling, which is of the same color.  At the center of the room
is a large agafari table suitable for either large or small meetings.  A
multitude of identical wooden chairs line the table on both sides, with a
slightly larger one at the head of the table.

The Ral Temple Entrance~
     This immense building rises high to the west, though its size is
dwarfed by the Great Pyramid to the east.  Its stone walls are
accompanied by massive obsidian pillars that support the heavy stone
roof.  Many knights and templars walk in and out of this massive
building, and occasionally the odd clerk or army servant.  A unit of
armed Jaguar Knights stand guard at the entrance, their weapons drawn and
their eyes intently scanning the road and walls before them.  Above the
archway entrance, there is an intricate obsidian carving of the two moons
of the God-King, with a night-black jaguar leaping overtop.  The jaguar's
eyes are set with large chunks of jade, though they appear quite small
from this distance.  The temple wraps around to the north and south.

Jaguar Plaza~
     This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.

is a huge obsidian carving of the Two Moons of Draj - the larger of the
two, Guthay, at the forefront.  A templar, accompanied by a group of
knights, stands guard in front of the entrance to prevent unwanted
visitors from entering the temple.

     This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.
     A large pillar with an obsidian jaguar perched on top stretches
upwards into the sky.

The Pyramid Steps~
     This small plaza sits at the base of the Great Pyramid, which
spans hundreds of feet into the sky.  To the east is a lengthy staircase
that runs straight to the top of the Pyramid, where the God-King performs
the ritual sacrifices.  There is a door at the base of the pyramid that
leads down into the slave pens, which also reside somewhere below.

The Pyramid Steps~
     These steps lead upwards for several hundred feet towards the top
of the Great Pyramid.  The steps are fashioned from sun and wind blasted
white stone, and are kept very good condition.  A large obsidian obelisk
sits on either side of the steps, and there is a pair at each major level
around the outside of the pyramid.
     The wall of the monstrous domed gladiatorial palace lies to the
north, stretching upwards and out of view.

     This narrow corridor leads east and west under the first set of
steps that run up the Great Pyramid.  To the north are the holding pens
for the king's slaves, huge rooms caged with long obsidian bars.  This
passage is infreqently used, as slaves generally traverse further north
up the corridor and into the Arena.  Generally, this passage is used by
the king, and the templar's when they are emprisoning new slaves.  The

A Bend in Palace Road~
     The road here bends around the arena, heading east towards the
Palace Gate, and south towards the Great Pyramid, which sprawls into the
sky like a dagger.  The dirt-brown road, frequented primarily by gawking
Draji commoners, is hard-packed, yet still throws up a considerable
amount of silty dust as it is stepped upon.  Not far to the north lies
the Two Moons wall, which protects the city proper from harm, including
siege weapons, arrows, and upset Draji commoners.

A faint din is audible from the other side of the twenty foot high

numbers of commoners stroll about occasionally, though most of them
appear to be on their way out of Two Moons, as it is largely restricted
to members of the army, the templarate, the psionicist cult, and those
who stand in the God-King's favor.

A Bend in Palace Road~
     Palace Road curves southwards around the arena, but it also
serves as an intersection, branching off towards the House of the Mind to
the east.  The road is mostly unoccupied, though a group of lightly clad
men and women in black and jade colored robes occasionally walks by.  The
area sprawls southwards, like a half-popped dome bubble in the sky.  Its
plain grey walls occasionally blend with the everchanging color or the
heavens above.

     This hall serves as an entrance to the eastern half of the

the lower ranking members of Draj's army.  The walls and steps here are
significantly less well-maintained than their twins in the west stands,
as no one seems to care for the commoners' comfort.  The grey stone steps
are uneven, unpolished, and very dirty.  Stains from blood and vomit dot
the floor and walls; having not been cleaned properly, these stains are
set and add a certain punctuation to the difference in class that exists
in Draji society.

agafari hardwood serve as seats.  A slender handrail snakes up the ouside
of the stairwell, which curves gently into the open stands.

The Arena Battleground~
     All around you rise the stands of the arena.  The hardpacked dirt
underneath your feet is stained deep red with the blood of fallen slaves
and gladiators.  There are several slivers of bone protruding from the
ground, indicating the sad remains of those who lost their lives to
entertain Draj and its inhabitants.

Serpent's Way~
     This broad street, which crosses the Jaguar gate to the west,
connects Two Moons to the rest of Draj.  To the east, it leads right into
Jaguar Plaza, which can be seen by the four monumental Jaguar obelisks.
The road is paved in dark grey cobblestone, and sounds of clapping feet
can be heard as people walk along.  To the south, the impressive Ral
Temple rises from the ground, though the great pyramid behind it makes it
look small.
       The street is generally busy, and fairly clean as it lacks the
feces left by mounts and pack animals which can be found throughout the
Drajian Commons.  The level of noise within Two Moon's walls is a relative
din compared to the monstrous bustle coming from outside where most of
this city's residents live.

Serpent's Way - Before the Jaguar Gate~
     A massive gate spanning two-dozen vertical feet grants access
along Serpent's Way into Two-Moons City.  Sentry towers, one on either
side of the gate, cast a looming presence over the road and the handfulls
of people who mill about upon it.
       The gate itself is a monstrous creation, built from gigantic
slabs of burt agafari hardwood and polished obsidian studs.  With the
gates closed, two halves of an obsidian jaguar come together, the
animal's jade-eyed stare watching the entrace with uninterruptable vigil.
No less than a dozen Draji soldiers patrol the ground inside the gate, in
addition to those stationed in the towers.

Jaguar Plaza~
     This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.

A Circular Training Grounds~
     Empty description.  This large training ground sits below a huge
domed ceiling.  There is easily enough room for several hundred hundred
troops, and the area looks like it has been used by that many.  The
various sparring circles are scratched, chipped, scuffed, and generally
abused despite their sturdy construction.  In one of the corners, there
are a number of benches set beside a large pile of obsidian weights.
Against another part of the wall, there is a group of wooden sparring
dummies set up for troops who lack sparring partners.  Overall, this area
is sweaty, bloody, and well-used.

     This narrow corridor leads east and west under the first set of
steps that run up the Great Pyramid.  To the north are the holding pens
for the king's slaves, huge rooms caged with long obsidian bars.  This
passage is infreqently used, as slaves generally traverse further north
up the corridor and into the Arena.  Generally, this passage is used by
the king, and the templar's when they are emprisoning new slaves.  The
floors are covered in various shades of large pebbles

A Bend In Wall Road~
     This lengthy road skirts just south of the Great Pyramid, between
the giant structure's base and the twenty-foot-high obsidian wall to the
south.  To the east, this road continues towards Guthay Temple and the
army barracks, and to the west it leads to the king's Royal Menagerie.  As
a main throughfare for the templars and knights of Draj, this road is
highly congested with foot traffic.

Wall Road East~
     This road, which circles most of Two Moons city, is bordered on
the east by a massive, twenty-foot wall.  To the west lies the barracks
for the king's army: the Jaguar, Eagle, and Ark knights.  A little
further north is Ijuna Road, which leads west through the barracks to the
House of The Mind, the temple for the psionicist cult of Draj.  The tip
of the Great Pyramid peeks over the top of the barracks to the west,
though it is some distance away.

piercing sentry towards jut into the sky to keep vigil over the expansive
flat that stretches southward away from the city.  A seemingly endless

     Within this expansive square is displayed the sum total of the
fanatical Draji warrior attitude.  Tall obelisks, each one topped with an
artful jaguar leaping through the air, separate the field into a series
of squares, many of which are currently occupied by pairs or even trios
of combatants.  Bright banners strung between the obelisks display the
vibrant blue and yellow emblem colors of the city, though they come
nowhere near to touching the ground.  It is impossible to walk anywhere
without sidestepping a deep red blood stain, or even the occasional piece
of severed flesh.

A Dimly Lit Staircase~
     This dimly lit staircase leads down into an extremely
foul-smelling dungeon.  The walls here are stained with bloody hand
prints and streaks, as many an individual has been dragged down these
steps against their will.  A singular torch on each wall provides little
illumination, though enough to prevent people from tripping and falling
down the obsidian steps.

On The Side Of The Pyramid~
     This landing is one of many that line the side of the Great
Pyramid.  The montsrous tower itself is built from enormous slabs of
carved sandstone, though they appear to be more durable than the average
rock found in the desert.  The view from here is remarkable, as most of
Two Moons is clearly visible.  The view also peeks over the top of the
Two Moons wall, and displays a scant amount of the drudgery of the
commons and slums of Draj.  Directly below the temple to the north west
lies Jaguar Plaza, and several people can be seen milling there.

Atop The Great Pyramid~
     From atop the pyramid, the view is absolutely incredible.  Draj
looks small from this height, and Two Moons even smaller.  There is a
large sacrificial altar at the front of the plateau, carved from white
marble with black veins.  It is stained heavily with blood, and its
surface has been chipped slightly from repeated dagger stabs.
       To the north, the domed roof of the the Palace of Gladiatorial
Combat rises from the ground like a giant bubble, while the impressive
Ral and Guthay temples lie to the west and east respectively.

of the room, padded with soft suede leather, with a small table next to
it for holding drinks and food.  A large window to the north gives a
clear view of the the arena, the dusty battlegrounds where gladiators and

chained to the walls, to the ground, and even a few to the ceiling,
though they are mostly rotting remains.  A thin coating of slime clings
to this room and all who reside within it.  Sounds of moaning, screaming,
and fighting surround you, though their sources are imperceptible due to
the darkness.  Cockroaches and rats scurry around the floor, scavenging
for rotting flesh.

The black column is polished to a gentle shine and displays intricate
carvings of noble eagles soaring through the heavens, as well as a
singular carving which depicts the Two Moons of Draj.  The room is lined
with hard agafari benches and serves as a waiting area for those wishing
to speak with the head official of the Temple Guthay.

bare wall is painted dark blue, and has a large rack attached to it for
storing gear of various kinds.  Above the door is a painted agafari
carving of two moons.  The smaller one on the left is a dull silver,
while the one on the left is a faint gold color.  A large desk,
approximately eight feet wide and five feet deep, sits in in the middle
of the room.  Various papers, maps, reports, and trinkets are neatly
organized on the desk's smooth agafari surface.  A large wooden chair
sits behind the desc, its back and sides ornately carved with moons and
jaguars.  The seat and arms of the chair are upholstered with supple
brown leather.

enormous slabs of yellowish stone which give this room a musty, dirt-like
smell.  The floor is build in levels, the lowest one leading down into a
crypt-like passage, and the highest leading to a door to the north.  The
door is protected by four burly guards, each one armed to the teeth with
various melee weapons.  The vaulted ceiling curves overhead, and displays
a large painting of a battle-scene.  There is a large black obelisk on
either side of the door to the north, one with a depiction of the moon
Ral, the other with the moon Guthay.

A Stone-Walled Passage~
     This squat hallway spans just over seven feet in height, making
it a difficult passage for tall individuals to walk comfortably.  It is
constructed on all four sides by moderately sized slabs of yellow stone,
though the floor is interspersed with equal-sized squares of obsidian.  A
faint draft runs along this corridor, and carries with it the smell of
dirt.

emits a sweet aroma, reminiscent of a forest in bloom.  Directly above,
there is a large, multi-paned window that allows sunlight to perpetually

Wall Road~
     A high wall, aproximatley twenty feet, stretches upwards, its
mighty obsidian structure blocking entrance to the inner city.  The
street that runs along it is relatively empty, as those who traverse it
are mostly templars and their knights.  There is a large gap between the
wall to the south and Ral Temple, which lies to the north.  The ground
unpaved, and instead features a common blend of dirt and small rocks.

Jaguar Plaza~
     This enormous circular plaza sits before the towering Pyramid ot
Tektuktitlay.  In the far corners, large obsidian obelisks cast
ever-shifting shadows across the plaza; topped with large carvings of
jaguars, these shadows almost resemble a primal dance when viewed from
above.  The ground is paved with criss-crossing rectangular stones, most
of which are rough obsidian.  Around both sides of the pyramid sprawl the
ferocious Ral and Guthal temples, though their sizes are easily dwarfed
by the pyramid to the south.  At the base of the pyramid sits a large
spiked rack, upon which the slaves have impaled the heads of their
god-king's ritual sacrifices.  Many of the skulls are bleached pale white
from the harsh intensity of the sun.

A Cluttered Selling Floor~
     This expansive room houses literally hundreds of arms, ranging
from the smallest of obsidian daggers to the largest and heaviest of
bardiches.  The walls are completely hidden behind the dozens of racks,
shelves, hooks, and cabinets, and the only free space appears to be near
the front of the room by a long, waist high table.  A number of clerks
bustle through the store, conversing with potential buyers as they fetch
items from here and there, while several larger individuals stand watch
near the door.  Through the back, a door leads to a comparatively barren
room which is padded on the floor straw.

entrance to the large, two story house to the north.  A small path leads
between thorny, spike-leafed plants to the west, and into a small door on
the side of the house.  A similar, but better concealed path leads to the
east.  There is a grey stone statue in the middle of the couryard,
surrounded by a thin, circular garden, which is mostly covered in moss.
The statue depicts the current head of House Shom, a figure clad in
flowing robes of uniform color, and holding a long, double-edged blade
across both hands.

cooking area at the back of the room, brining both hot and cold plates of
food to the serving area to be picked up by the House members.
There is a hazy mist of steam floating throughout the room, as a result
of the bubbling and boiling stew that is constantly being prepared.
A hodge-podge of aromas lingers here, and is rather unpleasant considering
the amount of different foods found in this room.

painted obsidian crest, the Ranasha emblem, of a seven pointed star
surrounded by unhilted daggers.  To the south, east, and west, a high
stone wall blocks assess, funelling all trafic through the large gate to
the south.  Pairs of orange-clad servants bustle about, carrying various
things in and out of the estate.  The ground is tiled in smooth, obsidian
squares, with thick black moss growing in between them.

peculiar shape of a drop of water.  With a rounded base that tapers into
a thin point near the top, it defies all the architectural normalities
that can be found elsewhere in Draj.  A small door set into the north
side of the temple allows entrance to the building.
     A small walkway wraps around behind the building, bordered by

A Wide Alley~
     This wide alley leads northward from Serpent's Way.  Far to the
east, the din of the Draji market can be heard above the crowd that
lingers here, here, with all the hawkers' cries that are its trademark.
There is a squat building on the eastern side of the alley, with a small
sign constructed of bone and giant hair that displays a carving of a
snarling jaguar.  To the right of the door, which itself is a simplistic
design of agafari, there is a small obelisk depicting a warrior standing
over his victim, reminding any visitor that in Draj, the warriors rule.
The obelisk's warrior has his victim's head speared at the tip of his
sword, with many feathers adorning his headdress.
     Sounds of conversation and clinking dishes emanate from the
doorway beneath the sign of the snarling jaguar.

The Outer Market~
     This congested road makes up the circumfrence of the market,
which lies directly to the south of here.  There is literally no one
standing still upon it, as those wishing to trade must enter the market
fully to avoid being trampled.  The side of the road closest to the
market is dotted with six-arm-high poles, each topped with a head-sized
obsidian jaguar.  To the outside of the road, narrow streets lead away
towards the various plots of land that have been allocated to the
commoners clans.  Not far to the north lie the plots belonging to the
Nobility, which can be distinguised from those of the common people by
the protective mud-brick walls which surround them.

Outside Draj~
     Patchy, cracked ground, battered by time and countless boots,
animals, and wagon wheels sits motionlessly beneath the vigil of the twin
watchtowers to the north.  To the east and west, a wide moat of soupy mud
leads towards the horizon, its brown color seeming to shift endlessly in
the hot air.  To the south, barrens of nearly lifeless, stony ground span
as far as the eye can see, with only the smallest traces of vegetation
growing through the harshness.
     Each watchtower, a miniature of the Great Pyramid which can be
seen far to the north east, houses at least one priest, a number of
half-giant soldiers, and a score of human archers.  At the base of the
pyramid, priests interview those entering the city of non-Draji descent.

Serpent's Way~
     Within this expansive square is displayed the sum total of the
fanatical Draji warrior attitude.  Tall obelisks, each one topped with an
artful jaguar leaping through the air, separate the field into a series
of squares, many of which are currently occupied by pairs or even trios
of combatants.  Bright banners strung between the obelisks display the
vibrant blue and yellow emblem colors of the city, though they come
nowhere near to touching the ground.  It is impossible to walk anywhere
without sidestepping a deep red blood stain, or even the occasional piece
of severed flesh.

Serpent's Way~
     This road, paved in angular-cut slabs of sandstone and smoothed
together with hard-packed gravel, spans approximately thirty feet across,
with slightly more room near the minor intersections which lead to the
dwellings on the north and south sides.
     Very far to the east, Two Moons City rises above the relatively
puny dwellings that make up the bulk of the Drajian commons.  The Great
Pyramid, as its focal point, juts like a broad spear into the sky.

Atop a Bridge~
     This broad stone bridge affords a rather unspectacular view.  The
uncrossable mud moat lies beneath, its bleak brown color seeming to suck
the very life out of the surrounding area.  Far to the north east, the
crest of the Great Pyramid can be seen somewhere in the middle of Two
Moons City.  The view in between lies at such an angle so that the tops
of most of the buildings within the Drajian commons are visible, though
the aesthetic qualities of mud and clay brick are rather plain.

The Ascension Fields~
     Within this expansive square is displayed the sum total of the
fanatical Draji warrior attitude.  Tall obelisks, each one topped with an
artful jaguar leaping through the air, separate the field into a series
of squares, many of which are currently occupied by pairs or even trios
of combatants.  Bright banners strung between the obelisks display the
vibrant blue and yellow emblem colors of the city, though they come
nowhere near to touching the ground.  It is impossible to walk anywhere
without sidestepping a deep red blood stain, or even the occasional piece
of severed flesh.

Moat Road~
     This broad walk encompases the perimeter of The Ascension Fields,
which lies just off the inside of the path.  Like many of the streets of
Draj, this walk is paved in dull-brown mud bricks, and lined on the
outside by various statues and lanterns, all of which display the
dominant warrior attitude of the city.  Far to the eas, over the crest of
squat mud-brick houses lies Two Moons City, with its focal point The
Great Pyramid, cutting impressively into the sky.

Warrior's March~
     This highly decorated road runs west towards Serpent's Way, which
can be seen off into the distance, and east towards the wall which
surrounds Two Moon's City.  Above that wall, the monolithic pyramid of
Tektuktitlay juts like an unnatural splinter of stone into the otherwise
clear sky.  This road itself is adorned with statue after statue,
sculpture after sculpture, and painting after painting, all depicting the
belief in the glorious battle-driven nature of this city.  Dozens of
headdress clad Draji walk the street, their multicolored feathers
ruffling in the wind, which seems to travel almost constantly towards the

Moat Road~
     This unpaved road runs along the wide, impassable moat of mud,
which lies like a river of opaque bleakness to the south.  To the north
lies the Draji commons, and the scores of squat, mud-brick pueblos that
are contained within.  At evenly spaced intervals along the road,
piercing sentry towards jut into the sky to keep vigil over the expansive
flat that stretches southward away from the city.  A seemingly endless
array of statues dot the road, depicting everything from bloody
decaptitations, to leaping jaguars, to the twin moons of Athas.
     The road runs straight east until it connects with Serpent's Way.

Atop a Bridge~
     This broad stone bridge affords a rather unspectacular view.  The
uncrossable mud moat lies beneath, its bleak brown color seeming to suck
the very life out of the surrounding area.  Far to the north east, the
crest of the Great Pyramid can be seen somewhere in the middle of Two
Moons City.  The view in between lies at such an angle so that the tops
of most of the buildings within the Drajian commons are visible, though
the aesthetic qualities of mud and clay brick are rather plain.

     A wide, sandy road cuts through the barren scrub to the east.  A
faint, ever-present breeze dusts the road with a constant stream of
grainy sand.  To the north side of the road, there is a large boulder,
smoothed down by time and ferocity of the elements.  At the base of the
boulder, a small community of ants scurries about, their black carapaces
shining dully under the sun's light.
