1) No starting equipment.
2) timers on kick/bash need tweaking.
3) bash fail apparently bashes your victim...
4) fully thirsty/hungry entering game
5) Bashed npcs don't stand up once timer gone..
6) this beggar isn't dead yet.  (ok, not really a bug.  hoping he has food.)
7) bartenders dont seem to have shop data.
8) some guy in a bloody bar or something like that had a borked desc.. looked corrupt
9) #5 confirmed.   failing bash bashes opponent.
10) actually, make that #5 confirmed.. #5 is inaccurate, it's just really slow.
