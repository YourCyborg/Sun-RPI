A dirty, crippled old man~
A dirty, crippled old man stands here leaned on a crutch, his hand out for alms.
~
     A bent man stands here, dirty and bruised.  His long, unkempt hair falls
in black and grey stripes down his shoulders and covers one of his
glossy, blood-shot eyes.  Beneath the old and withered face, filled with
wrinkles and bruises, his throat is badly scarred with broad slashing
lacerations.  The body is bent and broken, the left arm is missing and
the left leg is twisted and strangely curled forcing him to limp heavily
supported on his good leg.

a pale-yellow tent~
A pale-yellow tent with elfish markings stands here, trinkets in bone and stone hanging at the entrance.~
     This pale yellow tent is made from several large pieces of thin leather
that has been sewn together with more enthusiasm then skill.  Its surface
is painted with hand marks and elfish symbols in a dark-red colour.  In
the entrance one can see trinkets hanging inside tied to leather strings.

a circular dark-blue tent~
A larger circular dark-blue tent is erected here, the gloss of the valuable blue fabric dampened by the dust from the market.~
     This circular tent in a valuable glossy dark-blue cloth is held up by
bone sticks along its sides and a pole in its middle, the metal point
sticking up over the centre.  It is high enough for a half-giant to enter
and measures ten or fifteen big human steps across.  A banner flying on
its side reveals that it is owned by a noble house, and a narrow leather
strip sewn to the tent left of the entrance shows a templar seal of
approval.

a small semi-circular brown stand~
A small semi-circular brown stand is placed here in a central position, smelling of freshly baked bread and ripe fruit.~
     This patched old stand has seen many years, it being originally a
reddish-brown cloth that has been patched with leather.  Its frame is
made from wood and bone, also visibly repaired many times with various
different sorts of materials - yet it looks steady and firm.  From its
inside drifts the fragrance of baked bread and ripe fruit, on the side is
discarded a small pile of rotten fruit that is focus of much attention
from a small swarm of insects.

a simple hide tent~
A simple hide tent is erected here and stands slanting and unsafe in an odd angle, a cured skin covering the entrance.~
     This hide tent is made out of skins of a fairly average quality,
although the upkeep has not been done with much skill.  Badly patched,
the tent seems to lack much value, its cone-like shape tilting to the
left dangerously.  The entrance is an oval hole covered by a reddish skin
hanging over the entrance.

reached a bone-white colour has been stained and cleaned for years and
carries recent smudges of sand and dust.  Its entrance is covered by a
flap overhead sustained by wooden sticks.  To the side of the entrance is
a mark, displaying water being distributed - drawn skilfully on a
circular leather patch.

shirt hangs on a thin wooden pole.

An odd cupola-shaped tent is placed here; built from pieces of leather, skin, bones and shells.~
     This spherical tent is made on an outside frame of bones, and is a
composite of products from animals and beasts.  Made with skill, the
eccentric store is marked by a large shell on the side of the opening -
showing a few pieces of armour.  The entrance itself is made from two
large flaps of leather that has been sown with bones to look like two
large wings that has to be opened to enter.

the grotesque statues~
The grotesque statues are placed all over, mainly clustered in the corners of the hall.~
     The whole area is decorated with oddly twisted and corrupted
female statues, beautiful but having arms like bird-wings, or a
snake-tail instead of legs.  The most notable female statue seems to have
been toppled from the platform and lies broken on the side, still
grasping its male phallus in a very obscene gesture.  All of them are
made in the same dark-red stone as the walls, but some of them have dark
black veils running across their smooth surfaces.

religious markings~
religious markings~
Religious markings covers the wall behind the raised platform.~
     The wall behind the raised platform harbours a great collection
of carvings separated into neat squares.  Markings are deeply cut into
the dark-red stone and display various rites or religious acts that are
followed through by beings in cloaks, sometimes the odd female-beast
creatures are seen amongst the cloaked figures and seem to be the subject
of worship.  Crowded in between the more obvious signs, are letters of an
obscure origin.  Many of the rites are so well-described that it would be
possible to re-enact them without the specific words, this could entail
everything from sacrifices on the altar to sexual acts.  There is a
twisted, evil nature of the carvings and symbols that lies as a dark
cloud over the old stones.

A large sacrificial altar stands on the raised platform, against the northern wall.~
     On the platform against the far-north wall is a sacrificial
altar, wide enough to lay out a half-giant and with deep grooves for the
blood to run along the edges and down holes in the platform.  There is a
hole in front of the altar, having a small sliding descent into darkness,
making it possible to crawl into the altar and then downwards.

a vast mound of corpses and refuse~
A vast mound of corpses and refuse dominates this whole area and yields a horrible stench of decomposing remains.~
     An enormous amount of carcasses and rubbish has been throw down
the hole for a very long time, long enough for the huge pile to spread
out over the entire area and form almost a hill of decomposing flesh,
bone, cloth and other materials.  Bodily fluids from the dead have seeped
through the heap, and southwards down a gentle slope to form in a vile
pool.  For someone that can avoid being incapacitated by nausea, there
are hundreds of years of gifts for the dead in the revolting mass.

A wooden sign is placed here over the northern door, showing a group of victorious fighters.~
     On an old and very sturdy wooden sign there is painted a group of
warriors that are dressed in shining metal and stands with drawn metal
weapons on a heap of defeated foes.  In the background is the desert and
mountains that are a familiar sight from Tyrs walls, vaguely and very
artistically drawn in the air - there is the face of a man looking down
on the scene with a stern demeanour.

folded from the belt going between the legs, covering the groin and most
of the wearer's buttocks.  The material is fine and there is tiny red
embroidery going down the edges.  It is meant to be very short and due to
the thin fabric - really enhance and decorate more then it conceals.

Inside The Stadium Gate~
     The old gates arcs high over a stone-laid passageway partly covered with
the relentless sand.  Made from good and solid stone, it still shows the
passage of time, and the patterns and carvings displaying the faces of
rulers and their symbols of glory are worn and hard to make out.  A
variety of individuals move through the area and armed guards
occasionally makes their presence known.  Being the second most populated
gate leading in or out of the city besides the Caravan Gate, there is
people here all hours of the day.

Beneath The Altar~
     A mild slope leads down to this chamber, nothing more then a
smooth square room with dimensions of ten times ten feet.  It is made in
dark-red stone and seems to be completely empty and undecorated.  From
the hall above a feint red glow can be seen through the small tunnel
leading gently upwards.

Just East Of The Stadium Gate~
     The broad street made up of large and worn stones lead all travellers
from the Stadium market to the Stadium gate and there are marks well
visible that shows how many people travelled over these stones and for
how long.  There have been many repairs, and to the side a small group of
slaves is replacing stones; the rejected, worn-down or shattered stones
placed in a large pile.  On both sides there are high stone walls,
wearing freshly repaired carvings displaying the stern face of Kalak, the
ruling wizard-king.

Approaching The Stadium Gate Along The Wall~
     A large semi-circular intersection that carries a large part of the
city-states life-blood, leading southwards towards the Stadium market and
northwards along the city wall - to the west it shows the way towards the
Stadium gate.  Over the nearby walls one can see in the distance the
Ziggurat to the east, as well as the Golden tower to the south.  Wagons,
animals and beasts traffic this area more or less constantly, and guards
of the city watch over the crowd.

Along The Great Wall Of Tyr~

semi-circular intersection in the south - along the great wall that
shields the city from the harsh lands outside.  The wall reaches high
into the air, displaying both cracks and wear by time, yet it seems
mighty and unshakable.  Quite a few inhabitants of the city passes
through here, and the guards patrol regularly.

that has been swept and moved to the sides, and more drifts in from

carving of an older man made in the wall itself, he seems to wear the

Broad Street Near Stadium Market~
     Here a broad and lazy curve of the road leads from a large semi-circular
intersection in the north, into the Stadium market in the east.  Even at
some distance, the smell of the market reaches here; unwashed bodies,
perfumes, spices, freshly made food, raw hides and much more that mixed
up with the sound of negotiations, arguments and the shouts of salesmen
speaks clearly of the markets vitality.  On the southern side along a
sizable wall are placed some hardy tree-like plants in large shallow
clay-jars.

Market Entrance~
     At the entrance of the Stadium market, the steady flow in and out of the
market is broken off against paused wagons and beasts, as well as stands
and peddlers that for some reason have been unable to find better places
deeper inside the chaotic market.  Many curses and angry words are spoken
here as some wagon-driver tries to get past; the guards are plentiful due
to the crowding and the frequent disputes.

small void in the chaos - all moving over ancient stones and mud that are
strewn with animal extremities, straw, broken trinkets, rotten fruit,
torn rags and other things thrown away or lost.  There is much pushing,
and the sound from the crowd and the smell from the market are stunning.
Occasionally a wagon or other party forces their way through followed by
much arguing and curses.

citizens, and the sound and smells are dazzling.  The ground is made of
ancient stones that are covered by dry dirt and sand, as well as all kind
of by-products of the markets vivid existence.  Only against the wall,
near the more well-kept stands are there some calm.  In the south one can
see an impressive statue.

Middle Of Stadium Market~

presence of the inhabitants of Tyr are intense and unavoidable.  Wagons,
creatures, stones and all other goods of the city passes through are sold
or bought around the stands and peddlers that frequent the area.  The
Stadium market is the newest and one of the most vital places in the
city, and in the markets centre that is made very clear by the small
traders, caravaneers, local craftmen and elven tribal traders that fills
up this area.

Stadium Market At Statue~
     Beneath the impressive statue showing the ruler of the city, the
immortal sorcerer-king, a market thrives in its shadow.  Rising more then
fifty feet in the air, the statue with its dark blue-grey stone gleaming
almost moist marks the splendour of the tyrant.  There is a huge crowd of
people here, and the alarm from the trading is sometimes over-powering.

stands pushed up towards the walls of nearby buildings are even
well-swept and tended to by eager merchants.  The silence and small ponds
of fear and awe that follows the Templars are more frequent here as their
quarters lies to the south.

wagons carrying iron from the mines passes through here daily to be
swallowed by the Templars quarters to the south.

A Corner Of The Stadium Market~
     Merchant stands and Tyr citizens finding themselves some rest are found
near the walls in this fairly calm part of the market.  Traders belonging
to the elven tribes are more visible here then in any other part of the
market, and so are the guards - creating a dull and almost hostile mood
that seems to lie over the area as a soothing blanket.  Towards the
eastern wall are several rough tables, and benches made from square
pieces of low-quality sandstone, the peddlers refrain from using them but

Stadium Market~
     This part of the market is filled with sound, smells and commerce.  From
stands and wandering peddlers many of the 'white' goods, and occasionally
some of the 'grey' can be found.  Smell of freshly baked bread is mixed
with perfume, and the sound of bargains made and animals protesting make
it hard to be heard without raising ones voice, adding to the flair of
the market.

Stadium Market West Of Stadium~
     Still within the sound and smell of the market, the stands and peddlers
thin out and the quality diminishes.  To the east lies the wide street
leading to the Stadium itself, sounds are sometimes heard from that
direction.  The Stadium is the single largest structure in Tyr, besides
the Ziggurat itself - and they both loom over the eastern view as great
marks of the city-states power.  Humbled by the gigantic rainbow pyramid
with its mosaics to Kalak's honor, the stadium itself in its size takes
the breath out of many visitors where it stands broad and simple between
the Golden tower of the Templars to the south-west and Kalaks Ziggurat
further east.

Corner Of Stadium Market~
     This corner of the market is slightly less loud and chaotic then other
parts of the market, having fewer citizens trying just to pass through.
Some of the stands pushed up towards the walls of nearby buildings are
even well-swept and tended to by eager merchants.  At moments one can
even hear noise from the Stadium to the east.  Guards moves often through
the stands here.

Broad Street Towards Stadium~
     A broad street carries all visitors back and from the Stadium, wagons
come through here with materials and by-products of the activities daily.
This is equal true for the occasional line of slaves to the slave pits
and some carrying chair that moves someone important in seclusion behind
silken drapes.  The street is paved with wide and strong stones,
noticeably worn by use but with little need for repairs.

Stadium Market Before House Of Trade~
     Not far from the centre of the market lies the House of trade, formation
of large stone-buildings that holds the more well-established traders.
Noble houses and rich merchant families can afford their own room within.
Around the opening to the house is a certain degree of tranquillity
brought on by the guards - but just a small distance away the stands and
peddlers gather together as if proximity to the southward entrance would
yield respectability and grandeur.

A Pale Yellow Tent With Elvish Markings~
     Inside this pale yellow tent, the smell of spices and old leather hangs
in the air.  Through the thin leather the sounds of the market is only
slightly muffled, but gives enough privacy to allow for a calm
conversation.  In thin leather strings hang trinkets made from bone,
stone and leather.  In the northern part there is placed a long wooden
table where a selection of goods has been spread out.

     A large area inside this tent is filled up with the ambience of calm,
the blue walls and roof contrasted with black wooden furniture and
strings of heavy, blue sand set out in an richly amount around the floor.
Smell of perfume and the heavy cloth of the tent shut out the market, and
give the illusion of being elsewhere.  The long wooden pole with iron
reinforcements in the centre is circled by skilfully crafted tables,
broad and stable.  On the side to the east lies a few low couches dressed
in short, black fur - the area closed off with a silk rope in a
semi-circle supported by a few slender ornate poles in bone-white wood.

     The room inside the stand for a visitor is clearly limited by a large

The counter is however fairly clean, and contains freshly baked bread and
a selection of fruit.  Fruit that lies to ripen in the heat as well as
the baked bread has a very strong flavour that fills the air.

small fortune in water; stored in jars, water-skins and pouches.

Visible in the tent is goods laid out for sale, mostly simple clothes in

     Inside this stand makes little difference from being outside, with the
flaps open the stand is exposed three-quarters of its circumference to
the market.  The sounds and smells of the market drifting inside, one
still feels the scent of fresh and new leather goods.  Towards the inner
wall there is a small wooden table and the wares are hung on leather
strings onto the frame, quite a few slender sticks from birch is used to
make the construction work.  For sale are baskets, bags, pouches and such
containers of many colours and materials - mostly keeping to simpler and
less expensive types.

An Odd Cupola-Shaped Tent~
     The tent is shaped vaguely like a ball, and the construction means that
no room inside is used up for supporting poles.  From the inside, the
light coming through the various materials creates a strange
kaleidoscopic effect at daytime.  Half of the tent seems to have use as
work-shop with leather sheets on the ground and a few tools and materials
wrapped up in neat bundles against the wall.  The other half, near the
entrance carries a few short racks that display armour.

     The fairly spacious hide tent seems abandoned, with only a few cheap
wooden remains of furniture and some rags to show evidence of it having
been in use.  A rich splattering of red-brown spots are drawn across the
side of the tent, a grisly display of past events.  The many patches of
the old tent seems even uglier from the inside, and there are plenty of
tears and scratches that would need repairing.

painted in rather artistic motives showing battles where warriors dressed
in Tyrs black colour always are described as heroic and triumphant.
Against the wall there is placed a worn table with a small semi-circular
sofa, the smell of the room speaks tales of it having been used both for
drinking and carnal pleasures in the past - even if it has been cleaned

created by the various buildings there is plenty of obscured spots where
two servants can slip away and practice the pleasures of the flesh, or
where the over-refreshed merchant might cast up the contents of the feast
- something is that rather apparent if one strays of the main path.  As
the only attempt to freshen up this passageway there are wall paintings
in the form of some rather artistic descriptions of war and old tales in
the colour of burnished gold, leather skins shield from the worst
sunlight and small jars placed throughout the area burns with cheap
incense.  Mainly merchants, customers and the occasional servant pass

creating a soothing shade during the day, and dancing shadows at the
night when the lanterns are brought out.  Around this inner yard and
mostly to the south and the west there are clusters of buildings built
together into the complex that is called the House of trade.  In the
centre is a small statue where the stone flowers are severely stylised
yet still breath organic life.  There are guards here at all times of the

Peaceful Dome~
     The inside of this spacious dome is decorated by green plants,
and silken banners hanging from the mosaic inner roof.  The banners carry
symbols and letters, making clear what noble houses and merchant groups
that are of importance here.  Beneath the banners are several discreet
gatherings of low table, couches and comfortable divans - where many men,
women, elves and dwarves speak about trade an leisure dressed in silken
clothes.  What is dealt with here is not goods, rather shares in
enterprises, loans based on interests of next years potential profits and
other things that are far above the understanding of the common
inhabitant of Tyr.  Not surprisingly there are quite a few black robes
showing the presence of the templars, feeding of the plenty that exists
here amongst these wealthy elite that smokes expensive herbs in glow-pots
decorated with gold and gems.  Guards are as plentiful as they are
discreet and aware, no-where is seen the guards wearing the black of Tyr
but rather those colours and arms of various houses and traders.

     In a large hall, simple and elegant with white stone and broad
logs in bright timber - with sizable cloth draping in gentle blue, yellow

counters with high-quality parchments, the sparse but tasteful
decorations in metal, costly glowing crystals creating light to the
careful shaving and posture of the guards create an atmosphere of taste

Trading Quarters Of House Stel~
     The large halls open to the public are rather majestic, with open
faade with pillared sides.  Colonnades give the structure an appearance
of great lightness and elegance with rich interplay of light and shadow.
The closeness of other buildings shield from harsh winds and great bronze
lanterns illuminates when the sun does not.  The chosen materials are
stone of a light-sand colour, and shockingly wine-red and purple
engravings on pillars and columns.  A few guards stand around a small
raised platform where some tables and parchments are to be seen, there
are no items for sale on open display.  Inner doors that lead into
private rooms carry the mark of House Stel.

Armstrading Lodge Of House Shom~
     Dark-blue bricks, no longer then a human thumb have been laid
with meticulous care to cover the walls.  Every fifth and seventh is
black or grey, creating a very soothing and gentle pattern.  To contrast
the floor is simple large squares in grey stone, and both the furniture
and the decorations are simple and brutal, leading the mind in a similar
direction as to the narrow shafts that lead in sun during the day -
creating the feeling of a fortress or an armoury.  Many of the most
expensive and exclusive pieces of armour as well as weapons can be found
here, but it is clear that the majority of buyers are here to lay down
custom orders.  As expected the number of guards are plentiful, and their
equipment impeccable.

Dwelling Of The Free Clothiers Alliance~
     These chambers consist of several oval clay and brick-based rooms
that is joined in a small dome.  All walls and roofs are hung with
shimmering pieces of fabric and cloth, of all colours and materials that
yields a rather motley impression.  The floor is strewn with straw in
some places and fine sand in other that all mix together as customers and
tradesmen moves around.  Along all walls several beautiful, yet different
benches hold samples of various goods made from cloth.  There are guards
here, not as well-dressed or expensively equipped as in other parts of
the house of trade, yet with hard and watchful eyes.

Trading Stalls Of House Tsalaxa~
     These stalls carry a lively interplay between free-moving lines
and shapes - as well as elegant forms in the way of mural wall-paintings.
The space where House Tsalaxa accepts customers are not arranged along
one single axis, nor according to basic geometry but twist and turn to
draw the eye towards ever new vistas - without degenerating into a
confusing disarray.  Along the various levels of floor and small steps
and buttresses in dark wood and reddish stones there are plentiful of
decorations, furniture and elegant figurines all placed to create the
impression of playful elegance and refinement.  Several guards belonging
to the house stays discreetly out of the way, while customers wanders
around and inspects chattels of all kinds.

Inner Yard At The House of Trade~
     Most of the sky above this rather sizable circular area is
blotted out by large cloth drapes in a soft blue colour, creating a
soothing shade during the day, and dancing shadows at the night when the
lanterns are brought out.  Around this inner yard and mostly to the south
and the west there are clusters of buildings built together into the
complex that is called the House of trade.  There are guards here at all
times of the day, and traders of all levels of wealth and importance move
through the yard along with their customers, treading back and forth on
elongated smooth stones in grey and dark red.

     A fairly large room, all decorated in tones of the same colour,
soft cloth with the occasional blotch that has been impossible to remove
hangs along the walls covering the bare stone and dampening all sounds.
In the same white tone there is a thickly weaved mat that also has
intricate patterns of black and gold, the parts of the floor visible is
covered with smooth pale stones.  Up in the roof, in the middle of the
room hangs a lantern that can easily be raised and lowered with a bronze
chain attached to the wall near the entrance of the room.  Over the area
that holds the bed, worn silk drapes in stained white falls down on all

Luxurious Oval Room~
     This fairly large egg-shaped room is formed with four shallow
step-like circles going around the room, and are mirrored in the roof.
That results in that the door to the western wall is almost a grown mans
waist-height above the main floor.  Covering the floor are thick rugs of
fur, and the walls are hanged with leather masks and prepared heads from
all conceivable wild animals.  There is a slight smell of perfume in the
air, and a large fan is installed on the southern end of the room in a
bone frame that allows manual labour to cool the room's interior.

     Stretching across the length of the inn, a hallway leads here
east to west on the second level from the ground.  On bronze holders
along the wall hangs lanterns and a thick red carpet covers the floor and
collects much of dust, sand and dirt that visitors bring along.  Long
strips of thin hide that has been bleached pale and is painted with
abstract red and black patterns hang every few steps for decoration and a
dry and flowery scent fills the air.  Once in a while someone passes
through on their way to or from a room; there are often heard voices or
laughter from the thick, wooden doors.

opens up, there are a few shallow alcoves against the walls around the
rooms though that holds privacy behind worn drapes of various colours.
There are giggles and muffled voices heard inside some of the alcoves and
occasionally someone passes through on the way to their rooms.

with small crude etchings done by amateur hand.  It is clean, and with
fairly good height in roof, along the wall several wooden pegs have been
hammered into drilled holes.  The smell of spices and baked bread comes

corner are a basin laid in orange-red bricks complete with oil tray and
body scrape.  On all walls there are hung thin sheets of skin, likewise
painted and gives the spacious room a very rich flavour without very
expensive materials.  Near all four walls there are placed lanterns in

many of the tables, tools and ovens to make food that requires more
preparation then roasting over hot coals.  In its northern end are laid
ovens for baking in reddish bricks and the centre of the room is lined
with tables, hanging from special wooden and bone frames above the tables
are tools; knifes, ladles, pans, handheld meat grinders, whisks and many
other things.  Most of the food made with the current owner is simple,
bread or things that can be roasted over the hearth in the serving room.
Only in the early mornings there are a few helpers here and makes bread
as well as marinates meat and fruits for the coming day.

several rooms to the sides, some tables and chairs and most obviously a
large staircase leading upwards, its wide steps of dark wood wide enough
for two men laying down across.  Behind the staircase a pair of thick
hatches of a trapdoor leads down to a cellar, the upper end of a ramp is
visible that is most likely used to drag up barrels from below.  A strong
smell of food and the sound of voices drift in from the main room, and
although this room is a lot less used then the southern room - there are
always someone around.

Serving Room~
     A visitor from the market to the south walks right into a large
and noisy room, it is formed roughly like a semi-circle with an rather
fair amount of tables and benches to the south, and the room arching off
towards the north where a part the room is fenced off by a impressive bar
counter - solid wooden tables in a square against the wall.  In the
middle of the room is a very big circular heath in stone where the coal
and stone filling glows on which food is prepared on spits.  The air is
still rather cool compared to the outside, because of the four large fans
that are made from wood and skin; each manned by five slaves.  When it is
warm outside the creaking from the large arms and the moaning of the
slaves keeps on relentlessly only to stop when the slaves change places -
soothing the heat of the air.  While filled with all kind of individuals
from Tyr's population, temporary visitors are more plentiful here then
any other group - slave traders, desert wanderers, tradesmen and
merchants off caravans from all lands can be seen here.

are minor walls and the sides of buildings to the south.  The road is
well-paved with wide stones and there have been recent repairs.  Dust and
sand has drifted in from outside, goods and people are still coming
through this area in a rather crowded fashion, and the city guards make
their presence known.  As one comes closer to the elven quarter, with the
warrens and the shadow square to the east there are more elves on the
street and the guards looks more alert and suspicious then on other parts
along the wall.

Quite a few citizens passes through this area, silent and nervous, or

with silken curtains and hardy beasts of burdens moves in and out from

more pleasant smells of perfume and food.  Also the occasional sound of

Along The Wall, Passing By The Noble District~
     Here the broad street follows the outer wall of the city and
passes through the noble quarter; there are minor walls and the sides of
buildings to the south.  From the south the smell of perfume and
expensive food filters over the walls, as well as the occasional sound of
music and laughter.  The road is well-paved with wide stones and there
have been recent repairs.  Dust and sand has drifted in from outside and
the air is dry, smelling of the desert.  As one comes closer to the noble
district the road becomes cleaner and well-patrolled by soldiers wearing
the black colours of Tyr, even the occasional noble in silk is seen
accompanied by personal guards.

Along The Wall, North Of Silk Road~
     With the great outer wall of Tyr to the north, the Silk Road
leads southwards into the heart of the western noble quarter.  Wagons
loaded with goods, house servants, carrying chairs with silken curtains
and hardy beasts of burdens moves in and out from Silk Road.  There are
guards moving through the area at all times, and more pleasant smells of
perfume and food.  Also the occasional sound of music is heard from the
richer parts of the city filtering over high walls and through windows
from the south.

Stadium, Commoner's Seating~
     This area has seating for commoners.  The seating is low stone
benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a
host of peasants will be here to cheer on their favorite competitors.

Astrologer's District~
     The aquamanile district is distinct against the nearby craft
shops.  The persons that work here are members of a strict sect, renown
for their hardliner devotion to Kalak.  They can be easily picked out of
a crowd because they wear their hair braided.  It is rare to see one of
the aquamanilers without an embroidered cloak, the theme of which usually
glorifies their beloved sorcerer-king.  Despite their eccentricities, the
devotion of these craftsmen makes them favored by the Templarate.  They
never lie, so the word of an aquamaniler is seldom questioned.  These men
and women can be quite vocal on current events without fear of
retribution.  For the most part, they are content to spend their time
crafting the ritual vessels that the Ministry of the Kalak's Worship uses
for their some of their ceremonies.  So elegant are the aquamanile's that
the priesthood of other city-states sometimes places orders through these
fellows, daring the risks.

Bustling Marketplace~
     Those less fortunate peddlers have their goods spread out on a
blanket.  A pity for them that they do not even have shade to work in,
yet woe unto him or her that tries to get the better end of a deal from a
shrewd old peddler.  Depending on how much time on has to poke through
rubbish, it is argued that one can find the most interesting trade goods
from these folk.  Children are a common sight here in the marketplace.  To
a certain extent, the marketplace is a reasonable place to leave one's
children for the day in the absence of daycare.  Kidnappings are not that
likely in broad daylight in front of a crowd, and there is only so much
trouble that youngsters can get into.  Many actually work to earn their
keep, serving as delivery persons, errand boys and girls, and lookouts.
Other less respectable children run about in gangs, or sit about begging
all day.  Perhaps difficult to understand is the language and behavior of
the speculators - merchants who deal at high volumes over goods and
service that are not even delivered yet.  It can be a dangerous business
likely to cost the naive a small fortune, yet a profitable one for anyone
who can plan well and has the necessary monies and influence to get
through a deal.

Tavern~
     This tavern is fairly upscale, as much so as any that can be
found in Tyr.  The tables are made of polished wood, as are the chairs.
The place is cleaned at least once a shift.  No rats are visible prowling
about.  The floor is made of smooth interlocking stones instead of packed
clay like much of the buildings around these parts.  The crowd here is
mostly the servants of Templars.  Templars themselves seldom visit
Taverns, preferring to take their meals at their estates.

Warehouses -- Market Storage~
     This is the Warehouse district of Tyr.  The warehouses themselves
are built of brick.  Beams of wood support the high ceilings on these
structures, as do bone and rock arches, and vaulted ceilings.  Most of
the persons that work in these warehouses are slaves.  Warehouse work is
good for a slave who is too rough-cut for craft work or house work, but
who is not so unruly to be assigned to field work or sent up north.
During the day time, carts arrive to the warehouses, where they are laden
or unloaded with goods.  At night, these warehouses are locked up, and
placed under guard.

borrow money or to make payments.  Most of the clientele is well-dressed.
At night, the area is almost deserted and the shops are locked up.  This
block is well patrolled by guards.

Templar's Quarter, Near the City Wall~
     The templars themselves are arraigned in fineries.  Silk and
embroidered linen are favorite choices, often trimmed with a rare fur.
The templars are usually accompanied by a couple of attendants.  The new
attendants are easy to spot, always gazing quizzically at the Templar's
face for some sign of displeasure.  Veteran attendants are relaxed in the
company of their betters.  The buildings themselves are impressive to a
visitor.  Each block will sport several villas.  Each villa is a ring of
connected buildings.  An atrium lies at the center, a private garden not
generally visible from the road.  The exterior of the buildings are
bleached white.  Slaves scurry to and fro on errands.  While each slave
wears the signatory thin leather collar, they would otherwise be
identifiable by their modest hair-cuts and simple woolen garb.  Most of
the slaves have clean skin and a healthy pallor.  Attending to Templars
is considered good duty for a slave.

Templar's Quarter, Near the City Wall~
     The buildings themselves are impressive to a visitor.  Each block
will sport several villas.  Each villa is a ring of connected buildings.
An atrium lies at the center, a private garden not generally visible from
the road.  The exterior of the buildings are bleached white.  Slaves
scurry to and fro on errands.  While each slave wears the signatory thin
leather collar, they would otherwise be identifiable by their modest
hair-cuts and simple woolen garb.  Most of the slaves have clean skin and
a healthy pallor.  Attending to Templars is considered good duty for a
slave.  The fronts of the buildings are typically unadorned.  Frescos and
statues are definitely out of vogue.  One or two alleys can be spotted
with part of an old mural on it, but these are for the most part aged and
peeling.  Overall, the villas have a stringent quality to their facade.

Templar's Quarter, Near the City Wall~
     Carriages are a frequent site walking, or for riding a kank or an
inix.  Carriages are a frequent site throughout these streets.  Most of
them will be taking a Templar or his guests on some errand or to attend
some event.  Templars often adorn or customize their Carriages through
elegant paint- jobs or simple detailing as a statement of taste and a
form of self-expression.  Although many of the buildings in this quarter
are residential, each residence is accompanied by a handful of smaller
utility buildings.  A villa would not be complete without an adjoining
stable, slave-quarter, wood- store, smoke-house, wine-cellar,
guest-house, carriage-house and kitchen, as well perhaps as a few other
structures.  To the south there is the view of a variety of trees.  To
the west are the city walls.  Almost everyone walking the streets here is
well dressed or looks purposeful or official.  Vagrants are deliberately
barred from this area, and stand out like a sore thumb.

King's Garden, Near the Wall~
     To the north the villas of the Templar's Quarter are visible
through the garden.  For someone of the appropriate station who has a
moment to pause and reflect on the serenity of the scenery, this might be
a pleasant contrast.  The villas represent tame civilization, clearly
superior and coexisting with the garden, which represents the subordinate
tamed wildlife.  Pedestrians wander through the garden, usually staying
on any of the designated paths.  Some nobles and some Templars can be
seen, all of them off duty and therefore most of them in good humors.
Most of the passersby through the King's Garden are dressed in casual
finery, and have come here for the purpose of a relaxing walk.  Guards do
patrol here, but the surroundings usual tranquilize even them, and they
march with a spring in their step and generally mind their own buisness,
careful to stay out of the way of their betters.  Their job is to prevent
shady looking persons from wandering into the Gardens, but this
assignment is easy, since it would seldom occur to a vagrant to try to
enjoy a walk.

King's Gardens, Near Whitewashed Villas~
     There are slaves tending the plants, but their assignment is to
some degree an enviable one.  Unlike field slaves, teamster slaves or
mine slaves, the garden slaves must exercise a certain skill at their
work.  They therefore recieve better treatment, and have the sort of
pride that anyone might take in practicing an artform.  They have the
honor of tending a mighty Garden that is considered a Wonder of the
Athasian World, and is the envy of a Monarch.  Many of the plants that
grow in the garden are Moxicocuilatianixochitoca, one of several variety
of waxy ferns that grow in the far north.  These are exotic here in the
Tablelands.  They require a moderate amount of watering, and also a
king's ransom worth of soil.  Most desert folk never get to see anything
of the like in their life, and so may indeed wonder at this sight.

trees.  These trees are a domestic species.  They are nonflowering,
reproducing instead by vegetative propagation.  This means that they
share a common root system, with one single plant sending up trees for
mekillot lengths from this spot.  What makes them a favored plant for the
Gardens is the shade they supply.  At this point a few rings of carefully
pruned tlahtlacahui bushes ring a couple of rock gardens.  A bored
looking-guard or two is usually stationed here, not so much to prevent
someone from disturbing the patterns in the rock garden, as to prevent
someone from steeling any of the precious tlahtlacahui fruit.  These
fruit are regarded as a delicacy throughout Athas.  The tastiest part of
the fruit is the seeds.

surviving population of this rare plant in Athas.  Each bush sometimes
makes a sound that does indeed sound somewhat like a human, or an elf

Outside Warehouses~
     This is the Warehouse district of Tyr.  It's position near the
commoner's quarter makes it's property value low, hence an attractive
space to build a bunch of warehouses.  The warehouses themselves are
built of brick.  Beams of wood support the high ceilings on these
structures, as do bone and rock arches, and vaulted ceilings.  Most of
the persons that work in these warehouses are slaves.  Warehouse work is
good for a slave who is too rough-cut for craft work or house work, but
who is not so unruly to be assigned to field work or sent up north.
During the day time, carts arrive to the warehouses, where they are laden
or unloaded with goods.  At night, these warehouses are locked up, and
placed under guard.

     Many of the common folk here are dirty.  Their sand-marred skin
is a sign of their ill-health.  Folk from another world might falsely
assume that Athasians don't bathe.  Nothing could be further than the
truth.  They are forced to spend even more time bathing than usual,
because they can only afford a small pitcher of water to use.  Despite
their efforts, it doesn't do much for their skin.  Skin tone is often a
very blatant sign of wealth in Tyr.  This quarter is filled with the
houses of commoners.  The city is usually quiet near mid day, when most
people prefer to be sleeping.  Few stables are present among the houses.
Most of these folk cannot afford draft animals.  Although most of the
folk here do have jobs, they work in other parts of the city.

Boulevard~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and
trash.

Houses, Ringing Boulevard~
     The boulevard gives way here to a residential area.  The streets
here have a narrowish, winding quality to them.  A few of the streets
show evidence that this area was once long ago centrally planned.  Other
buildings and side streets have sprung up since then, lending their
layout to no superstructure or master design.  The people of this region
are a fair sample of the populace.  A few appear to be on the up-and-up.
Most of them appear to be on the down-and-out.  Although many of the
denizens of this neighborhood bear a conspiratorial aspect to their
faces, one can see here and there what appears to be an honest face.  The
houses themselves are mostly constructed of adobe bricks.  Little effort
has been made to white-wash the exterior of the brickwork.  A few of the
houses lack windows that open onto the first story.  Wood as a
construction material is scarce.  The houses are almost universally
without adornment.

recently constructed outhouses.  Others show the signs of recently
installed plumbing.  Plumbing especially is a fine amenity for commoners
to have.  It helps to keep the local rat population down.

Crooked Rows of Houses~
     To the east stands the city wall.  The wall is in good repair in
contrast to many of the dwellings here.  It rises high over the top of
the houses.  Close to the wall is a somewhat enviable place to own a
house, as wind and sandstorms are felt less.  The exception to this is
near one of the gates.  Houses near the gates are often burglarized more
often than houses near the center of the City.  The streets here are made
of packed dirt.  There is not much in the way of a major thoroughfare.
Many of the streets wind their way through the houses from the Boulevard
several blocks to the north.  Although the area in front of most houses
is devoid of sewage,many of the locals think little of littering the
streets with trash.  The streets are scarcely wide enough to permit a
carriage.  Garbage lines the streets and collects in the gutters.  Animal
bones are very common, being the discarded remnants of past meals.  Scraps
of fabric blow around as well, until they get tangled on something.
Little effort has been taken to remove debris from the road.

Shanty Neighborhood~
     Some of the passersby on the streets are slaves.  Slaves are more
common in the western part of the city than they are here, as most of the
persons who live hereabouts are freemen with little to no money.  They
sometimes make deliveries into this quarter, the most common reason for a
slave to be here.  This quarter has probably the highest concentration of
soldiers for the entire city.  One might think that more soldiers would
be needed in the better parts of town since there is more to protect, but
the truth is that criminals prefer to commit their worst crimes in the
poor parts of town, for reasons that are unknown to law-abiding folk.
Plenty of the houses here belong to elves.  Elves make for undesirable
neighbors.  They almost constantly steal.  Most elves have trouble
getting decent jobs, since few persons would want to employ one.  They
manage to scrape by, making a living somehow.

Houses, Near the City Wall~
     Many of the dwellers of these houses seem cordial towards their
immediate neighbors.  Some of the houses have a house-wife or a house-
husband sweeping the front of the house.  Few of these persons can resist
the urge to pause and exchange gossip with their peers.  Crime is a
serious problem in this neighborhood.  Few of the houses have any kind of
exterior furniture or decoration that could be stolen.  Crime also
governs the social habits of the folk.  Most of them stay home after
dark, unwilling to risk getting mugged.  To the east stands the city
wall.  The wall is in good repair in contrast to many of the dwellings
here.  It rises high over the top of the houses.  Close to the wall is a
somewhat enviable place to own a house, as wind and sandstorms are felt
less.  The exception to this is near one of the gates.  Houses near the
gates are often burglarized more often than houses near the center of the
City.

Even though the road in other parts of Tyr is paved with bricks the roads
here are mostly packed dirt.  Drainage is seldom a problem, as it very
rarely rains.

this quarter are in poor disrepair.  Here a house has a crack in it's
bricks, there a house has a sinking foundation.  Finding a skilled
craftsman to do any sort of work has been tough since construction began
on the Ziggurat.  Housewives and househusbands are forced to do the work
themselves.

Boulevard, at a Bend in the Road~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and

Templar's Plaza~
     During the day, this plaza gleams white under the hot sun.  The
tiles on the ground here are bleached white, and kept clean by slaves.
While nothing exists here that could be referred to outright as
sculpture, there are noticeable embellishments to the land here,
including a gentle architecturally gratuitous set of stairs, an
arch-laced awninged walkway, and a series of stone posts, each of which
has been cut out of a white alabasterine stone.  Several dozen plants set
in white pots serve to decorate the plaza, although each is kept tightly
pruned.  It's not unusual to spot a couple of small clusters of Templars
here, conferring with each other politely.

Amongst a series of Graneries~
     The granaries of Tyr are memorably recognizable structures.  They
are somewhat tear-drop shaped, allowing slaves to climb a ladder and pour
grain into a funnel at the top.  A gate near the bottom can be opened to
allow the grain to pour out.  Generally, fresh grain will be dried, then
added.  It is removed only during times of famine.  Several guards are
posted to prevent theft.  The sides of the granaries are made of small
bricks.  Rib-work supports the attenuated shape of the buildings.

Up in the Air~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and
trash.

Sand Depot~
     This is the Sand Depot - the central major wagon yard for the
city of Tyr.  The assemblage of wagons here is nothing less than
impressive.  This is generally the first stop for any wagon or argosy
entering or leaving the city.  From here, a caravan leader can have his
wagon cleaned of the dust of the desert by a team of slaves with brushes.
Also, he can purchase provisions, including tents, food and water.  Other
slaves are able to affect basic repairs to wagons, especially to their
wheels.  From here, a series of loading docks are set up in the sand.
These loading docks are large structures constructed of brick,
eliminating the need for slaves to awkwardly and dangerously hand goods
onto an off the wagon from disparate levels, or the uneven surface of the
sand.  Next, most incoming goods can be loaded onto carts.  Teamsters
haul these carts to warehouses, markets or other appropriate spots inside
Tyr.  Passengers are able to find a coach with a coachmen to transport
them to an inn or another destination, for a fee.  All in all, the slaves
that work here are kept quite busy.

Mercy Square~
     This square is formally known as Soldier's Square, but because
there are more mercenaries living nearby it was nicknamed Mercenary
Square, or "Mercy Square" for short.  A good many commoners congregate
here as well.  Often folk will take a walk about the square, sometimes
bringing their family.  There is not so much to see, and this area does
not receive the same level of maintenance as the plazas in more civilly
important parts of town.  Rather this is a good spot for folks to loiter
and listen to stories, or enjoy a pipe.  Periodically a patrol of on-
duty soldiers walks through, and everyone makes a big show of moving
about their business, only to return an hour or so later.

Tyrian Army, Storage Space~
     These buildings are Tyr's main barracks.  Regulars -liveried
soldiers in the King Kallak's army, frequent this area.  A reasonable
amount of discipline is exercised in their conduct and dress, even when
they are off duty.  However, when officers are not around, most soldiers
can be note + jocular enough.  This storage area is a mess.  Crates line
one wall of the large room.  Other boxes are stacked more haphazardly in
other areas.  Barrels are arranged in rows, circles, and sometimes in
less discernable patters.  Equipment has been stacked into piles, many of
which have tumbled over.  One corner of the storage room emits a curious
odor.

small fortune worth of weapons are kept in the charge of the
arms-masters, and undergo maintenance here as well.

benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a

     Seating here is somewhat more impressive than in the commoner's
area.  For one, the benches are made of a higher quality slate, and there
are backs to the seats.  Also, speaking truthfully, this area is kept
cleaner and does not have the smell of peasants.  Many of the booths are
in boxes, where a noble person or a merchant-lord can bring his family to
watch a game in comfort.  Sound quality from the arena floor is decent,
taking advantage of some of the properties of amphitheater.

watch a game in comfort.  Sound quality from the arena floor is decent,
taking advantage of some of the properties of amphitheater.

Boulevard, Outside of a Huge Stadium~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and
trash.

Stadium, Commoner's Seating~
     This area has seating for commoners.  The seating is low stone
benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a
host of peasants will be here to cheer on their favorite competitors.

Locksmith's District~
This region is sometimes referred to as the Locksmith's District.  Looking a 
few blocks in each direction, many of the buildings have a sign out front 
advertising the work of a locksmith.  Locksmith's sometimes keep odd hours.
If a nobleman finds himself locked out of his villa at some ungodly hour of the night,
then some unfortunate locksmith must let him in.
Many of the locksmith's favor fashions that are favored by the more respectable
artisans of Try.  They wear their beards long and pointed, their curly hair shorn 
close on top of their head.  They wear blue surtouts or camises, and tightly cinched
robes that don't restrict their arms so much when they're trying to work.
In a world where technology has stagnated over the past thousand years, 
lockcraft is one of the few areas of innovation.  The wealthy pay well to keep
their families and their valuables secured, and order the most recently designed
locks to be installed on their estates.  Thieves crack the locks a few weeks later,

Academy Campus~
     The campus of The Academy lies here.  A respectable garden rings
the buildings.  The school buildings themselves are rather antiquated,
although meticulously maintained.  Rumor has it that Kalak subsidises the
Academy himself, in order to ensure that there are enough bright minds
entering the Tyrian civil service.  A few students can be seen walking
between the buildings during class changes.  The whole affair is
accomplished without the use of bells, which are rare in a world devoid
of metal.  The students seem to have adopted a similar, simple style of
garb by mutual consent, favoring loose sleeveless garmets.  The
instructors themselves can often be picked out of the crowds.  They are
for the most part venerable folk -- Templars who have been put out to
pasture, retired Advisors from some of the succesful mercantile clans, or
respected sages.  The Campus Guard deters most forms of mischief from
passersby, as well as loitering.

Lampmaker's District~
     The city blocks surrounding this spot are populated by the
workshops of the Lamp District.  Tyrian patriots boast that more than
half of the lamps from the Tablelands are made here.  Fine lamps are one
of the few objects that can be safely built in Tyr through which an
artist can enjoy modest expression.  The lamp makers make myriad forms.
Some lamps resemble animals, some plants, some miniature cities.  Many
are carved from different types of stone, although the majority of them
are trimmed in some more exotic material suitable to sustain the heat.

Eggshell Worker's District~
     The city blocks here have seen some changes in recent times.  In
years past, this was renown as the eggshell district.  The artists here
would collect pieces of eggshell from some of the huge reptiles of the
desert.  Some of these eggshells would be quite large indeed.  They would
use many varieties of eggshell to craft pieces of artwork.  Sculptures
were the preferred product.  Art conosseiurs valued the eggshell
sculptures so much because of their fragile nature.  Especial care would
be necessary to prevent them from being damaged.  After the Purge, the
artisans here have switched to making beads.  Beads are tolerated by the
Templarate.  They may not capture the beauty of the eggshell sculptures,
yet the artists have to make a living.

Hourglass-maker's District~
     The streets here are lined with shops.  The shops have signs out
front, None of the shops have writing on them, writing being illegal in
the city of Tyr.  Instead, they rely on pictures to convey the purpose of
the shop.  The shops are primarily made of brick.  Wood is a scarce
construction material.  Hourglasses are a recent innovation in Tyrian
production, becoming popular only in the last few decades.  Their
craftsmanship is fairly straightforward.  A very few exotic models are
constructed that run on water.  Most run on sand or oil.  No stylishly
punctual Athasian's home is complete without an hourglass.

Diviner's District~
     One is now standing amidst the streets of the Diviner's District.
There are less shops per city-block here than on surrounding blocks.  In
fact, many of the houses appear to be residences.  Still, this area is
unmistakeably the area to find a diviner.  The men themselves are a
scholarly breed.  They customarily spend years of study under a master
diviner before they will have reached a level of mastery.  Even then,
they are often picky about what jobs they will take.  Theirs is certainly
something of an artist's temperment to their lifestyle.  Their craft
itself is arcane to regular folk.  The processes by which they arrive at
their results are esoteric.  Even then, diviner's practice something of
an inexact science.  Still, their work is precious to life on Athas.  No
king's reign can last without them.  Their work commands high prices.

Toolmaker's Row~
     Around these parts is where a merchant will go to buy tools, in
order to sell them later to the public at a profit.  Each trade, craft
and profession of Tyr has it's own associated set of tools.  And even the
toolmakers need tools, and so the cycle goes that separates men, women
and elves from beasts.  Most of the buildings here are workshops,
although storage sheds can be detected in the back of alleys, as well as
loading areas for carts.

Cartogropher's District~
     Buildings line the streets here, spaced widely apart.  At this,
the cartogropher's district, a wandering adventurer might be made welcome
of all places.  The truth is that not all cartographer's are the most
well- traveled of men and women.  Consequently, they are reliant on the
word and rumor of wanderers in order to garner information.  They are
sometimes known to hire a traveller, or a troupe of such to research a
distant realm.  Hiring for this is difficult.  Travel is as unsafe in the
Tablelands as in nearly any other realm.  One must question the
credibility of any sould brave enough to dare its furthest reaches.  To
compound the problem, erosive forces render the athas highly mutable.
Maps must be constantly updated if they are to remain useful.
Understanding all of note + this, it is not difficult to see why reliable
maps of the land of Athas are rare.

Origami District~
     Many of the buildings here are shells, the burned out remnants of
once bustling workshops.  By contrast to the nearby areas, it seems that
very few buisnesses have moved in to replace those workshops that were
destroyed in the Purge.  This was once the origami district.  The artists
that worked here would fold admirable little paper pieces that were
popular with wealthy Merchants, or Nobles who wanted to impress visitors
to their estates by their good taste.  There is less foot traffic through
this neighborhood than in surrounding neighborhoods.  A few wary looking
persons can be spotted congregating on a streetcorner.  They speak
together, griping loudly about this problem or that.  They watch
outsiders suspiciously.  Their garb is poor.  Very little about this
region seems inviting.

Seer's District~
     The streets here were once paved with fine bricks.  Through time,
use and exposure to the elements, they have deteriorated.  Their remnants
provide adequate riding and walking surfaces.  It is hard to tell whether
the buildings here are houses or workshops.  If they are workshops, it is
not immediately apparent what they sell, there being little in the way of
signs to mark the nature of business.  The garb of passersby is odd,
cloaks cut differently than commoners wear, although it is not generally
extravagant.  This is the Seer's district.  Here a superstitious peasant
can come to have his palm read or his fortune told.  It is illegal under
the King's law to practice the sight, or indeed any kind of sorcery or
witchcraft.  However it is rare for the Templarate to enforce this, as
fortune-telling is generally considered to be harmless.

Boulevard, North of a Marketplace~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and
trash.

Barracks~
     These buildings are Tyr's main barracks.  Regulars -liveried
soldiers in the King Kallak's army, frequent this area.  A reasonable
amount of discipline is exercised in their conduct and dress, even when
they are off duty.  However, when officers are not around, most soldiers
can be note + jocular enough.  This is one wing of the main dormitory of
the Tyrian barracks.  Bunks form neat rows filling up the bulk of the
room.  Although some effort has been made to tidy up this dorm, the truth
is that it smells like soldiers.  The bunks are neatly made according to
regulation.  Sleeping soldiers are here at all hours, perhaps attributing
to their shift-work.

amount of discipline is exercised in their conduct and dress, even when
they are off duty.  However, when officers are not around, most soldiers
can be note + jocular enough.  This is the recreation yard of the main
barracks.  The ground is covered in tilled sand.  A couple of tall trees
occupy one corner of the yard.  They are the pride of the soldiers.  They
provide shade, and are cared for by the soldiers themselves.  The trees
have obviously seen better days.  Depending on the time of day, soldiers
are not always here.  They mostly use the area to chat with their
comrades or enjoy a pipe.

Inside a Tavern~
     This tavern is situated at somewhat of an idyllic location.  It
is located both near the Ziggurat as well as one of the Royal Tyrian
military compounds.  Consequently, it gets a fair amount of business both
from off duty soldiers, and off duty construction workers.  This
assemblage of persons lends a certain atmosphere to the establishment.
Rough language, coarse dress and heated arguments are tolerated here.
Three standing social rules are - don't talk yourself into an argument
you can't fight your way out of, don't spill anyone's ale, and make sure
to pay your tab before you leave.  Other than that, a lot of rowdy
behavior goes down.  The bar top is constructed of bricks.  The tables
are made of stone and chitin.

Market~
     The smells of fresh cooking leaves a taste in one's mouth.  Food
vendors will press you to sample a taste of some ingredients, if they
think you are likely to buy.  Cereals, grain, insects, rice, legumes,
fruits and spices comprise the bulk of what they have for sale, as well
as a few imported foodstuffs that are less familiar.  During the busier
hours, the throng of shoppers press into you as you walk by.  There
simply isn't enough room for everyone who wishes to pick through all of
the goods available, and haggle for a bargain.  Becoming jostled is
commonplace, but no one seems to think much of this.  The exception is
the occasional passing lord, whose entourage clears space for their
infrequent trips to the bazaar - using brute force when needed.  A number
of shaded booths are grouped in clusters wherever an enterprising
merchant can get one established.  In an era without mass production or
decent distribution of comestibles, it can certainly be exciting to poke
about and to see what deals can be struck.  The booths offer a semblance
of privacy for the vendors who sell their goods here, or more usually
their services.  Massage booths exist alongside the booths of folk
astrologers, and wholesalers who await their next customer off of the
streets.

can be note + jocular enough.  This is the main mess hall of the
barracks.  Soldiers who have kitchen duty in one corner of the room cook
food, usually stews in large pots over well ventilated fires.  Soldiers
eat at regular meal times, filing into the room in a more or less orderly
fashion, and taking spots with their mates at any of the long stone
tables that occupy the room.

Kalak's Ziggurat, First Tier~
     This is the first Tier of Kalak's Ziggurat.  It is constructed of
a pattern of alternating adobe bricks and stone blocks.  Their geometric
pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

Stadium, Commoner's Seating~
     This area has seating for commoners.  The seating is low stone
benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a
host of peasants will be here to cheer on their favorite competitors.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Second Tier~
     This top of this tier is about six stories off of the ground -
quite high up indeed.  Construction is at an advanced state for much of
the tier.  Like the other tiers of the Ziggurat, this tier is
rectangular, proportionately so to the layer beneath it.  The Ziggurat,
then is effectively a series of concentric rectangular solids.  Slaves
work on portions of this tier, white-washing the surface until it gleams
in the sun.  Painters work on other parts, staining the bricks
decoratively.  Statues decorate parts of this level, although it would
take a connoisseur to recognize the style, perhaps influenced by elven
work.  Their subject matter invariably depicts aspects and incarnations
of the Highlord Kalak.  Some of the iconographies are fairly involved,
and their content is not immediately discernable to the reveler.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Third Tier~
     Construction on this tier is only partially finished.  This tier
is high enough off the ground to instill vertigo into most Athasians.  It
certainly towers over almost any other building in Tyr, with the possible
exception of King Kalak's golden tower, visible to the southwest.  Even
the ramparts of the city walls are visible below.  And yet, it's not
difficult to see that this is not the planned top of the Ziggurat.  The
foundation of more layers is laid near the center of this one.  The
center of the Ziggurat is not filled with rubble to save space, as an
engineer might expect.  Rather, it is built of a similar pattern to the
brickwork and stonework of the subordinate layers.  If anything, the
craftsmanship is more careful and the pattern more intricate near the
center.  Parts of this tier are unfinished, and it's necessary to pay
attention to where one walks.  Slaves toil all over the tier here during
the daytime.

pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Second Tier~
     This top of this tier is about six stories off of the ground -
quite high up indeed.  Construction is at an advanced state for much of
the tier.  Like the other tiers of the Ziggurat, this tier is
rectangular, proportionately so to the layer beneath it.  The Ziggurat,
then is effectively a series of concentric rectangular solids.  Slaves
work on portions of this tier, white-washing the surface until it gleams
in the sun.  Painters work on other parts, staining the bricks
decoratively.  Statues decorate parts of this level, although it would
take a connoisseur to recognize the style, perhaps influenced by elven
work.  Their subject matter invariably depicts aspects and incarnations
of the Highlord Kalak.  Some of the iconographies are fairly involved,
and their content is not immediately discernable to the reveler.

Stairs Ascending the Ziggurat~
     These stone stairs ascend the face of Kalak's Ziggurat, onto the
third Tier.  Anyone viewing the structure during dawn or sunset might
notice that it is perfectly aligned perpendicularly with the cardinal
directions.  The stairs themselves are very busy during the daytime.
Hosts of slaves make their way up and down.  Most of the ones that are
climbing up bear litters of construction materials.  Most of them that
are on their way down are doubtlessly on their way to bring more.  They
might look a little bit tired as they work, but their overseers, visible
near them at most times, allow them little chance for respite.  The
stairs are not entirely finished, and some parts do not have adequate
supports installed.  Reaching the crest of the staircase is tricky
business.

Stadium, Commoner's Seating~
     This area has seating for commoners.  The seating is low stone
benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a
host of peasants will be here to cheer on their favorite competitors.

Outside the Academy~
     The campus of The Academy lies here.  A respectable garden rings
the buildings.  The school buildings themselves are rather antiquated,
although meticulously maintained.  Rumor has it that Kalak subsidises the
Academy himself, in order to ensure that there are enough bright minds
entering the Tyrian civil service.  A few students can be seen walking
between the buildings during class changes.  The whole affair is
accomplished without the use of bells, which are rare in a world devoid
of metal.  The students seem to have adopted a similar, simple style of
garb by mutual consent, favoring loose sleeveless garmets.  The
instructors themselves can often be picked out of the crowds.  They are
for the most part venerable folk -- Templars who have been put out to
pasture, retired Advisors from some of the succesful mercantile clans, or
respected sages.  The Campus Guard deters most forms of mischief from
passersby, as well as loitering.

Stairs Ascending the Ziggurat~
     These stone stairs ascend the face of Kalak's Ziggurat, near the
southwestern corner.  Anyone viewing the structure during dawn or sunset
might notice that it is perfectly aligned perpendicularly with the
cardinal directions.  The stairs themselves are very busy during the
daytime.  Hosts of slaves make their way up and down.  Most of the ones
that are climbing up bear litters of construction materials.  Most of

more.  They might look a little bit tired as they work, but their
overseers, visible near them at most times, allow them little chance for
respite.  The stairs are gentle enough that climbing them is no challenge
for an unladen healthy person.  The ground is far enough to make any
lapse in attention an unforgiving mistake, and there is no railing for
one to lean on.

Hourglass-maker's District~
     The streets here are lined with shops.  The shops have signs out
front, None of the shops have writing on them, writing being illegal in
the city of Tyr.  Instead, they rely on pictures to convey the purpose of
the shop.  The shops are primarily made of brick.  Wood is a scarce
construction material.  Hourglasses are a recent innovation in Tyrian
production, becoming popular only in the last few decades.  Their
craftsmanship is fairly straightforward.  A very few exotic models are
constructed that run on water.  Most run on sand or oil.  No stylishly
punctual Athasian's home is complete without an hourglass.

Victory Square~

decorative tiles that lined the floor have been trampled, not only by
humans but by hooved beasts.  The reason for this is as plain as day to
see.  This square lies just to the south of Kalak's Ziggurat, the largest
structure in the city of Tyr.  Visitors who see it this close for the
first time are frequently amazed to behold its size.  The sheer tonnage
of the brick and stone that has been used in its construction has
required a minor miracle of engineering to coordinate.  It is necessary
to cross this square to reach the grand staircase of the Ziggurat, and as
such the square and its decor are looking fairly banged up.  Traffic
through the square is immense through all hours of the day, mainly of
slaves and workers on the Ziggurat.

Copper Smelts~
     This area is swathed in waves of heat.  The temperature is almost
unbearable.  This heat comes from a series of great peat bonfires.  These
fires are used to cook great clay cauldrons.  Inside of the cauldrons are
large piles of mined ore.  Slaves are adding coke and limestone to the
mix.  In fact, slaves are running all over the place trying to get their
respective jobs done.  The cauldrons they are using are huge and chimney
shaped, lined with fire brick.  Vents in the sides of the cauldron allow
air to enter, speeding the separation of the metal from the impurities.
The slaves that work here often wear very light shirts, or more commonly
work stripped to the waist.  Their musculature makes them almost beastly
to behold.  This is some of the hardest work for slaves to have.  Lest he
be exceptionally strong, no man can last at it longer than a few months.
A few Templars are here to supervise the work of the metal extraction.
They allow the slaves to take periodic breaks, to reduce the number that
collapse from heat exhaustion at their post.  The Templars are more
concerned with the loss of metal through the theft, hence the reason for
the close supervision.  Indeed, a few of the slaves need to use metal
tools in their work, in which case the tool would cost more to replace
than the slave.

Sage's District~
     This collection of brick buildings has been termed the Sage's
Distrcit, so named because of the assemblage of learned men and women who
choose to dwell here.  For these intellectuals, there is safety in
numbers.  A lone wiseman might be considered a ne'er-do-good or an
upstart.  A collection of them, by contrast, has become the Sage's
District.  Archeology, Lineology, History, Eugenics, Linguistics, as well
as a dozen other disciplines all have several representatives living
here.  In the afternoon, it is not unusual to discern a gathering of some
of these folk on a stoop in front of a dwelling.  There they enjoy a puff
on a pipe, or a draught.  The sage's are not given to strong drink during
the day.  While tightlipped around outsiders, it might take an
introduction to get in with these men and women of wisdom.  Most
wandering warriors or merchants would truly never see the need, of
course, being busy with the pursuit of wealth or the pursuit of
adventure.  Other folk are too busy with the pursuit of survival.

Clay Kilns~
     Brick towers protrude from the ground here.  Slaves form a
"bucket-brigade" up these low tower, passing up buckets of clay-dirt from
below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust of
wind, below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust
of wind, then pour a bucket of clay over the side.  The wind action
naturally segregates the particles according to their qualities.  Other
slaves measure the motion of the clay with their eyes, going to an
estimated distance from the towers to collect the best clay, which they
call Smectite.  This they sweep into more buckets, mixing it with ground
eggshell.  Nearby, other slaves mix the clay with water, kneed it, and
then form pots.  Some they create using potter's wheels, although the
less-skilled slaves make pinch pots.  They make their mark on these wet
vessels, then load them onto beast-drawn carts.  Nearby, the pottery is
fired in kilns.

Forges~
     The brick structures of the blacksmiths dot the area here.  These
small buildings are usually made of bricks.  They are notable by their
vents, allowing fresh supplies of air in and spent air to flow out.
Slaves haul buckets of water to cool the metal work, as well as smelted
metals and fuels in.  Templars and soldiers keep a close eye on the work.
Walking past one of the smithies, one can see a forge inside, with
bellows, a furnace and an anvil.  Very few forges exist in all of Athas.
It is unlikely that there are many forges in the Tablelands, save the few
within this industrial-park.  There is little in the way of roadway here.
Mostly paths wind their way along the routes taken by slaves.  Debris are
cast about haphazardly.

Sage's District~
     This collection of brick buildings has been termed the Sage's
Distrcit, so named because of the assemblage of learned men and women who
choose to dwell here.  For these intellectuals, there is safety in
numbers.  A lone wiseman might be considered a ne'er-do-good or an
upstart.  A collection of them, by contrast, has become the Sage's
District.  Archeology, Lineology, History, Eugenics, Linguistics, as well
as a dozen other disciplines all have several representatives living
here.  In the afternoon, it is not unusual to discern a gathering of some
of these folk on a stoop in front of a dwelling.  There they enjoy a puff
on a pipe, or a draught.  The sage's are not given to strong drink during
the day.  While tightlipped around outsiders, it might take an
introduction to get in with these men and women of wisdom.  Most
wandering warriors or merchants would truly never see the need, of
course, being busy with the pursuit of wealth or the pursuit of
adventure.  Other folk are too busy with the pursuit of survival.

Hempspinners~
     This area is for Hemp-workers.  Some of the slaves that bear
about the large bolts of hemp-fiber and spun-hemp are quite burly, but
for the most part the slaves that work here are the smaller slaves.
Comparatively, their work is not much easier than the work that goes on
at the heavy work- yards nearby.  Hemp arrives here in carts, pulled by
draft beasts.  Slaves with bone-tipped pitchforks unload this unto flat
areas.  Other slaves trample this under their boots, or beat it with
clubs to soften the fibers.  Then it gets shredded, sometimes by the
small fingers of children, before it will be hand-cleaned of debris and
then beaten again.  The result is soft shreds of hemp.  Other slaves take
these threads and - using the reverse- wrap method, constructs long
strands and threads.  This work is not hard, but it is tedious and by far
consumes most of the slave-hours.  Some of these threads will be braided
into rope.  Other slaves take the hemp thread and spin it through looms,
creating hemp fabric.  Hemp fabric is not soft, but it will do for
commoners to wear.

Seer's District~
     The streets here were once paved with fine bricks.  Through time,
use and exposure to the elements, they have deteriorated.  Their remnants
provide adequate riding and walking surfaces.  It is hard to tell whether
the buildings here are houses or workshops.  If they are workshops, it is
not immediately apparent what they sell, there being little in the way of
signs to mark the nature of business.  The garb of passersby is odd,
cloaks cut differently than commoners wear, although it is not generally
extravagant.  This is the Seer's district.  Here a superstitious peasant
can come to have his palm read or his fortune told.  It is illegal under
the King's law to practice the sight, or indeed any kind of sorcery or
witchcraft.  However it is rare for the Templarate to enforce this, as
fortune-telling is generally considered to be harmless.

Vellum Yard~
     Much of the work here is done inside of crude brick buildings.
The slaves here have a slightly easier job than other of the field
slaves, however their crafting liquors smell terrible.  This is where the
royal vellum is made that is used by the Templarate to inscribe
documents.  Obviously, they must need a lot of it.  Slaves collect urine,
and then add lye and essences to the mix to create a bath for the thin
leather.  The leather they scrape until it is quite thin.  Next they soak
the leather in the bath.  After it is tooled once again, it is dried,
perfumed and then loaded on carts headed towards the western part of Tyr.

Boulevard, North of a Marketplace~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and

Marketplace~
     The smell of kanks and other pack animals dominates the Tyrian
Marketplace.  Merchants call out to anyone wandering back, extolling the
values of their product.  When someone well-dressed walks by, they try to
press a sample of their wares into their hands, encouraging them to
inspect the craftsmanship.  The smells of fresh cooking leaves a taste in
one's mouth.  Food vendors will press you to sample a taste of some
ingredients, if they think you are likely to buy.  Cereals, grain,
insects, rice, legumes, fruits and spices comprise the bulk of what they
have for sale, as well as a few imported foodstuffs that are less
familiar.  During the busier hours, the throng of shoppers press into you
as you walk by.  There simply isn't enough room for everyone who wishes
to pick through all of the goods available, and haggle for a bargain.
Becoming jostled is commonplace, but no one seems to think much of this.
The exception is the occasional passing lord, whose entourage clears
space for their infrequent trips to the bazaar - using brute force when
needed.

Market~
     Although a fair amount of Tyr's populations is native to the
city, plenty of the peddlers that do business here are of foreign origin.
Consequently, if one is to make a living here, one must be prepared to
business with persons from distant lands.  It's not unusual for the more
successful merchants here to be bilingual or trilingual.  The smell of
kanks and other pack animals dominates the Tyrian Marketplace.  Merchants
call out to anyone wandering back, extolling the values of their product.

Residential District, near a Market~
     A series of villas line the streets here in neat, even rows.  They
are for the most part constructed of adobe bricks.  The bricks themselves
are white-washed with lime to a pearly finish.  They gleam in the sun.
Most of the villas are low to the ground - comfortable one-story affairs.
Plenty of them ascend to greater heights reaching two, three, even four
stories.  The quality of the neighborhood is a direct contrast to
surrounding environs.  The streets are swept clean of sand and rubbish.
The cleanliness evidences working sewer systems.  The streets are
spacious, their generous breadths permitting a variety of carts,
carriages, sedan-chairs, and pedestrians.  Slaves comprise the bulk of
the traffic here.  The slaves are for the most part well-garbed, and some
of them move at leisurely paces.  These slaves serve the merchant lords,
craft-masters, nobles and templarate that own villas here.  Few of these
esteemed persons have their official residences here.  Rather, they use
these pleasant villas for special appointments, or for when they'd like
to get away from it all.

Kalak's Ziggurat, First Tier~
     This is the first Tier of Kalak's Ziggurat.  It is constructed of
a pattern of alternating adobe bricks and stone blocks.  Their geometric
pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

Residences, Near a Bad Neighborhood~
     A series of villas line the streets here in neat, even rows.  They
are for the most part constructed of adobe bricks.  The bricks themselves
are white-washed with lime to a pearly finish.  They gleam in the sun.
Most of the villas are low to the ground - comfortable one-story affairs.
Plenty of them ascend to greater heights reaching two, three, even four
stories.  The quality of the neighborhood is a direct contrast to
surrounding environs.  The streets are swept clean of sand and rubbish.
The cleanliness evidences working sewer systems.  The streets are
spacious, their generous breadths permitting a variety of carts,
carriages, sedan-chairs, and pedestrians.  Slaves comprise the bulk of
the traffic here.  The slaves are for the most part well-garbed, and some
of them move at leisurely paces.  These slaves serve the merchant lords,
craft-masters, nobles and templarate that own villas here.  Few of these
esteemed persons have their official residences here.  Rather, they use
these pleasant villas for special appointments, or for when they'd like
to get away from it all.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Second Tier~
     This top of this tier is about six stories off of the ground -
quite high up indeed.  Construction is at an advanced state for much of
the tier.  Like the other tiers of the Ziggurat, this tier is
rectangular, proportionately so to the layer beneath it.  The Ziggurat,
then is effectively a series of concentric rectangular solids.  Slaves
work on portions of this tier, white-washing the surface until it gleams
in the sun.  Painters work on other parts, staining the bricks
decoratively.  Statues decorate parts of this level, although it would
take a connoisseur to recognize the style, perhaps influenced by elven
work.  Their subject matter invariably depicts aspects and incarnations
of the Highlord Kalak.  Some of the iconographies are fairly involved,
and their content is not immediately discernable to the reveler.

Stairs Ascending the Ziggurat~
     These stone stairs ascend the face of Kalak's Ziggurat, onto the
second Tier.  Anyone viewing the structure during dawn or sunset might
notice that it is perfectly aligned perpendicularly with the cardinal
directions.  The stairs themselves are very busy during the daytime.
Hosts of slaves make their way up and down.  Most of the ones that are
climbing up bear litters of construction materials.  Most of them that
are on their way down are doubtlessly on their way to bring more.  They
might look a little bit tired as they work, but their overseers, visible
near them at most times, allow them little chance for respite.  The
stairs are gentle enough that climbing them is no challenge for an
unladen healthy person.  The ground is far enough to make any lapse in
attention an unforgiving mistake, and there is no railing for one to lean
on.

Kalak's Ziggurat, First Tier~
     This is the first Tier of Kalak's Ziggurat.  It is constructed of
a pattern of alternating adobe bricks and stone blocks.  Their geometric
pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

have House employed soldiers, mercenaries, or trained slaves to look out
for them.  Everyone is much more comfortable if private security is able
to attend to the protection of these residences discreetly.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Third Tier~
     Construction on this tier is only partially finished.  This tier
is high enough off the ground to instill vertigo into most Athasians.  It
certainly towers over almost any other building in Tyr, with the possible
exception of King Kalak's golden tower, visible to the southwest.  Even
the ramparts of the city walls are visible below.  And yet, it's not
difficult to see that this is not the planned top of the Ziggurat.  The
foundation of more layers is laid near the center of this one.  The
center of the Ziggurat is not filled with rubble to save space, as an
engineer might expect.  Rather, it is built of a similar pattern to the
brickwork and stonework of the subordinate layers.  If anything, the
craftsmanship is more careful and the pattern more intricate near the
center.  Parts of this tier are unfinished, and it's necessary to pay
attention to where one walks.  Slaves toil all over the tier here during
the daytime.

work on portions of this tier, white-washing the surface until it gleams
in the sun.  Painters work on other parts, staining the bricks
decoratively.  Statues decorate parts of this level, although it would
take a connoisseur to recognize the style, perhaps influenced by elven
work.  Their subject matter invariably depicts aspects and incarnations
of the Highlord Kalak.  Some of the iconographies are fairly involved,
and their content is not immediately discernable to the reveler.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Second Tier~
     This top of this tier is about six stories off of the ground -
quite high up indeed.  Construction is at an advanced state for much of
the tier.  Like the other tiers of the Ziggurat, this tier is
rectangular, proportionately so to the layer beneath it.  The Ziggurat,
then is effectively a series of concentric rectangular solids.  Slaves

Kalak's Ziggurat, First Tier~
     This is the first Tier of Kalak's Ziggurat.  It is constructed of
a pattern of alternating adobe bricks and stone blocks.  Their geometric
pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

Residential District, near Merchant's Wall~
     There are not so many royal soldiers marching these streets.  For
the most part the patricians who own these dwellings have House employed
soldiers, mercenaries, or trained slaves to look out for them.  Everyone
is much more comfortable if private security is able to attend to the
protection of these residences discreetly.  Large stone walls surround
all these residences.  The stone blocks are much sturdier and more
fashionable than brick walls.  Machicolationed battlements crest the top
of these walls, stylized provocatively.  Although the walls are usually
unmanned, they can be reassuring to the folk who live here that there is
some measure of protection from the rabble.  Outsiders to the city will
notice a curious absence of artistic decor to these houses.  Clothing on
slaves will often display an embroidered livery, and awnings will
frequently exhibit detail work.  The villas themselves even go so far as
to show gratuitous arching to their design.  But the facades themselves
are completely devoid of the fine arts - either painting, mural or
sculpture.  Music cannot be heard in the streets, neither.

Lead Smelts~
     This area is swathed in waves of heat.  The temperature is almost
unbearable.  This heat comes from a series of great peat bonfires.  These
fires are used to cook great clay cauldrons.  Inside of the cauldrons are
large piles of mined ore.  Slaves are adding coke and limestone to the
mix.  In fact, slaves are running all over the place trying to get their
respective jobs done.  The cauldrons they are using are huge and chimney
shaped, lined with fire brick.  Vents in the sides of the cauldron allow
air to enter, speeding the separation of the metal from the impurities.
The slaves that work here often wear very light shirts, or more commonly
work stripped to the waist.  Their musculature makes them almost beastly
to behold.  This is some of the hardest work for slaves to have.  Lest he
be exceptionally strong, no man can last at it longer than a few months.
A few Templars are here to supervise the work of the metal extraction.
They allow the slaves to take periodic breaks, to reduce the number that
collapse from heat exhaustion at their post.  The Templars are more
concerned with the loss of metal through the theft, hence the reason for
the close supervision.  Indeed, a few of the slaves need to use metal
tools in their work, in which case the tool would cost more to replace
than the slave.

Slavebranders~
     The air around this immediate area is periodically split by the
sound of human screams.  This is where slaves and criminals are branded.
There is nothing sophisticated about the process.  Small fires are built
of wood, brush and peat.  Specially shaped fire-rocks Are heated on the
end of tongs.  Once the rocks are hot enough, they are applied to the
target exposed skin.  It is then usually that the screaming starts.  Some
slaves must undergo this process several times in their life when they
change owners, although process several times in their life when they
change owners, although hopefully only once as a baby.

Slaughterhouses~
     The large brick buildings of this area comprise the meat district
of Tyr.  The air is frequently split with the screams of suffering
animals.  Blood stains the sand around the buildings.  Slaves carry sides
of meat on their backs with pairs of meat hooks.  Other slaves lead long
lines of beasts into the buildings.  The slaughter of mammals is the
dirtiest.  Fortunately most of the animals that are killed here are
reptiles, insects, marsupials, birds or repsupials.  Many of the animals
stand placidly awaiting their death, the prospect of their own demise not
registering in their tiny docile ganglia.

Woodshaper's Lots~
     The slaves that are at work here have the unhappy task of shaping
wood.  Theirs is not the skilled craft of joiners, whittlers or
wood-carvers.  Rather, Theirs is not the skilled craft of joiners,
whittlers or wood-carvers.  Rather, these slaves get stuck with the
backbreaking labor of shaping large pieces of wood into construction and
industry materials.  Retaining-wall pins, pyramid-block rolling pins,
scaffolding, plank-work, and tool shafts are frequently among their work.
This wood they must shape with stone tools.  Much of the wood shaped here
will go for use on the pyramid.  It is unlikely that any of the products
made here will receive much appreciation, save by the pyramid builders if
they are thankful that the stuff doesn't break.  There is little room for
waste or error here.  Wood is imported at great expense.

Warehouse District~
     This is the Warehouse district of Tyr.  It's position near the
commoner's quarter makes it's property value low, hence an attractive
space to build a bunch of warehouses.  The warehouses themselves are
built of brick.  Beams of wood support the high ceilings on these
structures, as do bone and rock arches, and vaulted ceilings.  Most of
the persons that work in these warehouses are slaves.  Warehouse work is
good for a slave who is too rough-cut for craft work or house work, but
who is not so unruly to be assigned to field work or sent up north.
During the day time, carts arrive to the warehouses, where they are laden
or unloaded with goods.  At night, these warehouses are locked up, and
placed under guard.

Tanneries~
     This area is like many of the work-yards that surround this area.
A few shade-tents shelter the overseers, while the slaves toil out in the
sun.  Worktables are set up here and there, usually made of stone, bone
or chitin.  Stone tools fly under the hands of the slaves as they work at
their trade.  In many ways, this is the most foul area - the smell alone
is revolting.  Carts roll in bringing the bloodied hides of animals from
the slaughterhouses.  Slaves unload these hides, and set to work scraping
slaughterhouses.  Slaves unload these hides, and set to work scraping
them clean of fat and hair.  Next the skins are treated, usually in
solutions of animal brains.  Additional ichors are added to the leathers
in huge vats, of animal brains.  Additional ichors are added to the
leathers in huge vats, where they soak.  Through this foul-smelling
process, the skins are turned into tough or pliable leathers.

Chitin Working Yard~
     Slave overseers stand here and there, presiding over a field of
slaves.  It only takes one look at many of these slaves to guess their
purpose in life - hard labor.  This sort of duty is usually reserved for
slaves who have committed many infractions in their dreary lives.  They
are watched closely by overseers, soldiers and the occasional Templar.
These slaves have the task of working chitin.  They are not skilled
weapons-crafters, toiling at a skilled and honorable trade on quality
chitin.  Rather, they work with stones and bone knives to cut the chitin.
Other slaves treat it, in processes related to tanning.  Most of the
products here are cheaply made.  Chitin nails, chitin planks and material
joints are common.  Artisans or better-trusted slaves will do the detail
work.  These slaves are working on the shells of slain kanks and the
like.  Much of their product is destined for the distant Ziggurat.

Market~
     Stands are arranged in what appears to be spontaneously
developing rows.  Some of them Stands are arranged in what appears to be
spontaneously developing rows.  Some of them appear to be hastily
constructed, assembled shamble.  Others have been spruced up a bit, and
sport a few banners or decorative flags to draw the eye of the passerby.
Plenty of shady looking characters prowl the crowd.  At the risk of
sounding biased, most of the rougher-looking ones are elves.  Soldiers do
their best to keep an eye on the customers as well as the vendors.  During
the busiest times of the day, this marketplace is a fair place to have
one's pockets picked.  Although a fair amount of Tyr's populations is
native to the city, plenty of the peddlers that do business here are of
foreign origin.  Consequently, if one is to make a living here, one must
be prepared to business with persons from distant lands.  It's not
unusual for the more successful merchants here to be bilingual or
trilingual.  The smell of kanks and other pack animals dominates the
Tyrian Marketplace.  Merchants call out to anyone wandering back,
extolling the values of their product.  When someone well-dressed walks
by, they try to press a sample of their wares into their hands,
encouraging them to inspect the craftsmanship.

Barely Tolerable Houses~
     The people of this region are a fair sample of the populace.  A
few appear to be on the up-and-up.  Most of them appear to be on the
down-and-out.  Although many of the denizens of this neighborhood bear a
conspiratorial aspect to their faces, one can see here and there what
appears to be an honest face.  The houses themselves are mostly
constructed of adobe bricks.  Little effort has been made to white-wash
the exterior of the brickwork.  A few of the houses lack windows that
open onto the first story.  Wood as a construction material is scarce.
The houses are almost universally without adornment.  A few signs of the
times are in evidence.  For example, many of the houses here have
recently constructed outhouses.  Others show the signs of recently
installed plumbing.  Plumbing especially is a fine amenity for commoners
to have.  It helps to keep the local rat population down.

Run Down Houses Near a Deteriorated Wall~
     The streets here are made of packed dirt.  There is not much in
the way of a major thoroughfare.  Many of the streets wind their way
through the houses from the Boulevard several blocks to the north.
Although the area in front of most houses is devoid of sewage,many of the
locals think little of littering the streets with trash.  The streets are
scarcely wide enough to permit a carriage.  Garbage lines the streets and
collects in the gutters.  Animal bones are very common, being the
discarded remnants of past meals.  Scraps of fabric blow around as well,
until they get tangled on something.  Little effort has been taken to
remove debris from the road.  A very good proportion of the persons about
in this neighborhood are children.  The average age of this quarter is
low, a statistical reflection of the short life spans of the citizens of
Tyr.  The children run about in little gangs, having the run of the
streets and little supervision.

Run Down Houses Near a Deteriorated Wall~
     This quarter has probably the highest concentration of soldiers
for the entire city.  One might think that more soldiers would be needed
in the better parts of town since there is more to protect, but the truth
is that criminals prefer to commit their worst crimes in the poor parts
of town, for reasons that are unknown to law-abiding folk.  Plenty of the
houses here belong to elves.  Elves make for undesirable neighbors.  They
almost constantly steal.  Most elves have trouble getting decent jobs,
since few persons would want to employ one.  They manage to scrape by,
making a living somehow.  Sand blows over the street.  A thin layer of
sand goes some way to cover up the garbage, and to soak up the smell.
Even though the road in other parts of Tyr is paved with bricks the roads
here are mostly packed dirt.  Drainage is seldom a problem, as it very
rarely rains.

rubbish.  The neighborhood quite obviously lacks a functional sewer
rubbish.  The neighborhood quite obviously lacks a functional sewer
Children run about here and there, all over the place really.  Most of
them are deplorably thin.  They seem to have the run of the streets.  Few
of the adults take much notice of them.  Plenty of them are riddled with
disease, and some of them too weak to move much.  Alleys dart off of the
main roads this way and that.  It's easy to see from the size of the
roads and their geometric layout that this neighborhood was probably once
a nice place.  Nowadays, the large amount of rubbish littering the
thoroughfares make it almost inconceivable to get a carriage through
here.

Brickyard, Near a Crumbling Wall~
     The work-yard surrounding this point is the newly expanded
brickyards of Tyr.  It is unlikely that there is any larger brick
operation in all of the Tablelands.  The floor itself is paved in bricks,
mostly where new experimental batches had to be tested.  Slaves toil on
their projects.  Overseers supervise the slaves.  Work-beasts assist with
the heavy work.  Dirt and debris pile up until child-workers load it onto
carts.  This is a stopping point for finished bricks.  They are removed
from brick carts, and restacked more efficiently to prevent breakage and
to conserve space.  The overseers here are harsh, and work slaves at an
almost unmanageable pace.

wet bricks are loaded onto treated-chitin racks.  Slaves, using long
poles, into the heat of the kiln then push the racks.  Tarps block heat
from escaping the exit.  Steam escapes out of the sides, the loss of
precious moisture.  When the bricks are hardened, the racks get dragged
out of the heat, where they are able to cool.  Cooled bricks are loaded
onto beast-driven carts.  Teamsters haul most of these bricks towards the
distant construction of the Ziggurat.

Residences, Sprawled Near a Brickyard~
     This quarter has probably the highest concentration of soldiers
for the entire city.  One might think that more soldiers would be needed
in the better parts of town since there is more to protect, but the truth
is that criminals prefer to commit their worst crimes in the poor parts
of town, for reasons that are unknown to law-abiding folk.  Plenty of the
houses here belong to elves.  Elves make for undesirable neighbors.  They
almost constantly steal.  Most elves have trouble getting decent jobs,
since few persons would want to employ one.  They manage to scrape by,
making a living somehow.  Sand blows over the street.  A thin layer of
sand goes some way to cover up the garbage, and to soak up the smell.
Even though the road in other parts of Tyr is paved with bricks the roads
here are mostly packed dirt.  Drainage is seldom a problem, as it very
rarely rains.

could be further than the truth.  They are forced to spend even more time
bathing than usual, because they can only afford a small pitcher of water
to use.  Despite their efforts, it doesn't do much for their skin.  Skin

shoveling most of it into the pit-vats.  Other slaves stand at the bottom
of these vats, stirring the proportions of the reagents into a
brick-mixture.  The mixture is then pounded into brick shapes.  It gets
pressed, and then loaded onto carts to be sent to the nearby kilns.

much deeper, where workers have found veins, and have dug as far as they
might to exploit them.  The clay is then separated using a wind driven
process, and only the best fractions are taken by cart to a mixing area.
Slaves do most of this work.  It's grueling, and no man can last at it

     Many of the common folk here are dirty.  Their sand-marred skin
is a sign of their ill-health.  Folk from another world might falsely
assume that Athasians don't bathe.  Nothing could be further than the
truth.  They are forced to spend even more time bathing than usual,
because they can only afford a small pitcher of water to use.  Despite
their efforts, it doesn't do much for their skin.  Skin tone is often a
very blatant sign of wealth in Tyr.  This quarter is filled with the
houses of commoners.  The city is usually quiet near mid day, when most
people prefer to be sleeping.  Few stables are present among the houses.
Most of these folk cannot afford draft animals.  Although most of the
folk here do have jobs, they work in other parts of the city.

Brickyard, Near a MarketPlace~
     The work-yard surrounding this point is the newly expanded
brickyards of Tyr.  It is unlikely that there is any larger brick
operation in all of the Tablelands.  The floor itself is paved in bricks,
mostly where new experimental batches had to be tested.  Slaves toil on
their projects.  Overseers supervise the slaves.  Work-beasts assist with
the heavy work.  Dirt and debris pile up until child-workers load it onto
carts.  Pits pockmark much of this work-area.  The pits are of varying
depth.  In a few spots, they are quite shallow, where workers have probed
the ground to test for acceptable veins of clay.  In other spots they are
much deeper, where workers have found veins, and have dug as far as they
might to exploit them.  The clay is then separated using a wind driven
process, and only the best fractions are taken by cart to a mixing area.
Slaves do most of this work.  It's grueling, and no man can last at it
for long.

Ethnic Neighborhood, Near Workshops~
     The architectures of this region have a markedly different aspect
from the buildings of the rest of Tyr.  It's not that the commoners who
live here have a tremendous choice of materials.  For the most part, they
use the same adobe bricks as the other Tyrians.  However, they
incorporate more stone blocks into their design, and the neighborhood
certainly has it's own flavor.  After one's eyes adjust to the variety of
species, the next thing one notices are the varieties of humans that make
their home here.  Dark-skinned northerners can be spotted, their posture
formal.  Travelers from the far desert congregate as well, their robes as
white as limestone.  The air is split with the language of more than a
dozen languages.  A few sound almost song-like, invoking tones to enhance
meaning.  Others favor clicking sounds to punctuate words.  A few of the
men and women, representatives of very lively cultures, are jovial even
when they are sober, and seem almost frantic compared to some of the more
reserved Tyrians.

of this can be attributed to the influence of Nibonese cooking.  They
tend to favor the use of more earthy, strong spices in their cuisine.  The
effect on the passerby is either to make his or her mouth burn from the
memory, or his mouth water if they are used to it.

Fertilizer Cauldrons~
     This work area smells just plain rancid.  Huge boiling cauldrons
mark the fertilizer makers.  Fertilizer was a radical idea during the
founding of Tyr, however without it very little would grow in the
nutrient-poor soil.  Slaves circulate among the cauldrons, adding bits of
animal parts.  They stir these from time to time.  There aren't so many
slaves here as near the other work areas.  The slaves don't appear to be
generally healthy.  None of them hustle about their work, appearing quite
sluggish.  The scent in the air is revolting.  There is some distance
between these cauldrons and the other work areas, leaving it somewhat
isolated.  Supervision from overseers is lower as well.

Boneshaping Yard~
     This area is for the most part open.  The floor is littered with
sand blown in over the ages, and little work has been done to beautify
the space.  Bone splinters lie in piles here and there.  Overseers watch
the work from the top of small observation posts.  Tarps hang overtop of
them, shielding them from the worst of the sun.  Boneshaping work is
often hard on the hands.  Many of the slaves here wear leather work
gloves, which helps some.  Few enough materials are available to Tyrians
in any great quantity that can be used to etch bone.  Antler is one of
them, antlers being a common tool seen here in the grip of slaves.  The
work here is not high quality artisan work.  Rather, it is the sort of
stuff that the City needs in abundance.  Bone plates, bone needles, bone
stakes and bone poles are all produced here.  The smaller pieces are
often ground down into bonemeal for animal feed, or fertilizer .

Chitin Working Yard~
     Slave overseers stand here and there, presiding over a field of
slaves.  It only takes one look at many of these slaves to guess their
purpose in life - hard labor.  This sort of duty is usually reserved for
slaves who have committed many infractions in their dreary lives.  They
are watched closely by overseers, soldiers and the occasional Templar.
These slaves have the task of working chitin.  They are not skilled
weapons-crafters, toiling at a skilled and honorable trade on quality
chitin.  Rather, they work with stones and bone knives to cut the chitin.
Other slaves treat it, in processes related to tanning.  Most of the
products here are cheaply made.  Chitin nails, chitin planks and material
joints are common.  Artisans or better-trusted slaves will do the detail
work.  These slaves are working on the shells of slain kanks and the
like.  Much of their product is destined for the distant Ziggurat.

spontaneously developing rows.  Some of them appear to be hastily

sport a few banners or decorative flags to draw the eye of the passerby.
Plenty of shady looking characters prowl the crowd.  At the risk of
sounding biased, most of the rougher-looking ones are elves.  Soldiers do
their best to keep an eye on the customers as well as the vendors.  During
the busiest times of the day, this marketplace is a fair place to have
one's pockets picked.  Although a fair amount of Tyr's populations is
native to the city, plenty of the peddlers that do business here are of
foreign origin.  Consequently, if one is to make a living here, one must
be prepared to business with persons from distant lands.  It's not
unusual for the more successful merchants here to be bilingual or
trilingual.  The smell of kanks and other pack animals dominates the
Tyrian Marketplace.  Merchants call out to anyone wandering back,
extolling the values of their product.  When someone well-dressed walks
by, they try to press a sample of their wares into their hands,
encouraging them to inspect the craftsmanship.

Outside Warehouses~
     This is the Warehouse district of Tyr.  It's position near the
commoner's quarter makes it's property value low, hence an attractive
space to build a bunch of warehouses.  The warehouses themselves are
built of brick.  Beams of wood support the high ceilings on these
structures, as do bone and rock arches, and vaulted ceilings.  Most of
the persons that work in these warehouses are slaves.  Warehouse work is
good for a slave who is too rough-cut for craft work or house work, but
who is not so unruly to be assigned to field work or sent up north.
During the day time, carts arrive to the warehouses, where they are laden
or unloaded with goods.  At night, these warehouses are locked up, and
placed under guard.

Templar's Quarter, Near a Boulevard~
     To the west of the main road here is the boundary of the 
Templar's Quarter.  Armed militiamen patrol the streets.  They often have 
a casual look to them, as crime is not a serious problem in this part of the 
city.  Here and there a robed templar walks purposefully between 
buildings.  
The templars themselves are arraigned in fineries.  Silk and embroidered 
linen are favorite choices, often trimmed with a rare fur.  The templars are 
usually accompanied by a couple of attendants.  The new attendants are 
easy to spot, always gazing quizzically at the Templar's face for some sign 
of displeasure.  Veteran attendants are relaxed in the company of their 
betters.
The buildings themselves are impressive to a visitor.  Each block will sport 
several villas.  Each villa is a ring of connected buildings.  An atrium lies at 
the center, a private garden not generally visible from the road.  The 
exterior of the buildings are bleached white.

Boulevard, Running Past Stately Villas~
     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.
The street paving is obscured in most places by a layer of sand and
trash.

Guardpost~
     This is an official way station for the Tyrian militia.  It would
be a very rare occasion to walk past this point and not see it teeming
with guards.  Many of them are fairly relaxed.  This is their turf.  Some
of them lounge about, leaning on a building or talking with a comrade, as
they are getting ready to go on duty or get off duty.  For perhaps
understandable reasons, most other folk avoid this area.  To be fair to
the guards, they are mostly in an amicable mood when around their
fellows, acting formally when an officer walks by.

Wagonyard~
     This wagon yard is a transport center for this quarter.  Brick
loading docks facilitate movement of goods between carts, wagons and
argosies.  Sometimes the servants of one of the Noble Houses can be
spotted, and many of the wagons belong to one or another merchant lord.
Caravans that travel deep into the desert meet here as well, using these
yards as a safe place to store their wagons sometimes, or to rendezvous
for their next trek.

Templar's Quarter, Near a Boulevard~
     To the west of the main road here is the boundary of the

city.  Here and there a robed templar walks purposefully between

Outside a Noble's Temple to Kalak~
     This temple is rather large and long, it's length spanning well
over a full city block.  It is constructed of stone, each piece laid in
place by master artisans.  Several friezes decorate the upper third of
the masonry, although the subject matter seems largely restricted to
geometric shape.  Various aspects of the god Kallak are repeated around
the structure, both in relief sculpture and in mural.  Kallak the
conqueror is represented, as is Kallak the Savior, as is Kallak the judge
of souls, and even in more esoteric incarnations, including creator and
vindicator.  The temple is breathtaking to behold, and is meticulously
maintained.  This area is usually vacant, save for the regular patrols of
soldiers.

bleached white.  Slaves scurry to and fro on errands.  While each slave
wears the signatory thin leather collar, they would otherwise be
identifiable by their modest hair-cuts and simple woolen garb.  Most of
the slaves have clean skin and a healthy pallor.  Attending to Templars
is considered good duty for a slave.

Warehouses -- Market Storage~
     This is the Warehouse district of Tyr.  The warehouses themselves
are built of brick.  Beams of wood support the high ceilings on these
structures, as do bone and rock arches, and vaulted ceilings.  Most of
the persons that work in these warehouses are slaves.  Warehouse work is
good for a slave who is too rough-cut for craft work or house work, but
who is not so unruly to be assigned to field work or sent up north.
During the day time, carts arrive to the warehouses, where they are laden
or unloaded with goods.  At night, these warehouses are locked up, and
placed under guard.

Templar's Quarter, Near a Boulevard~
     The streets here are kept almost immaculately swept.  It's not
hard to see that many of these buildings must have plumbing.  Many of the
streets are lined with cobblestones, providing a good surface for
walking, or for riding a kank or an inix.  Carriages are a frequent site
throughout these streets.  Most of them will be taking a Templar or his
guests on some errand or to attend some event.  Templars often adorn or
customize their Carriages through elegant paint- jobs or simple detailing
as a statement of taste and a form of self-expression.  Although many of
the buildings in this quarter are residential, each residence is
accompanied by a handful of smaller utility buildings.  A villa would not
be complete without an adjoining stable, slave-quarter, wood- store,
smoke-house, wine-cellar, guest-house, carriage-house and kitchen, as
well perhaps as a few other structures.

Outside Kalak's Golden Tower~
     Standing here is a huge golden tower.  Usually there are a few
soldiers on duty nearby, and one can notice sometimes a pair of small
lizards that catch insects on the sand.  Most likely, though, one's
attention will be drawn to the great big golden tower nearby.  When up
close, it's not hard to see that the tower itself is not constructed of
solid gold.  It's easy enough to see how one could get that impression
from a distance.  This is especially true on a sunny day, when the golden
tower has a sharp gleam.  Instead of solid, gold, Many parts of the
tower, mostly near the top, are covered in large gold plates.  Further
much of the remaining exposed bricks have been gilt with a yellow metal,
most probably gold.  Visitors from another world might begin to wonder
what prevents the metal from tarnishing, although your average Athasian
might not even know that gold oxidizes when exposed to air.  The tower
itself is massively large.  It is between one dozen and two dozen stories
tall, making it one of the largest structures in Tyr.  Getting a precise
measurement of it's height would be difficult for a commoner, but even so
one might be skeptical that such a tall tower could be built using
contemporary building techniques by natural means.

King's Gardens, Near a Boulevard~
     There are slaves tending the plants, but their assignment is to
some degree an enviable one.  Unlike field slaves, teamster slaves or
mine slaves, the garden slaves must exercise a certain skill at their
work.  They therefore recieve better treatment, and have the sort of
pride that anyone might take in practicing an artform.  They have the
honor of tending a mighty Garden that is considered a Wonder of the
Athasian World, and is the envy of a Monarch.  Many of the plants that
grow in the garden are Moxicocuilatianixochitoca, one of several variety
of waxy ferns that grow in the far north.  These are exotic here in the
Tablelands.  They require a moderate amount of watering, and also a
king's ransom worth of soil.  Most desert folk never get to see anything
of the like in their life, and so may indeed wonder at this sight.

tallest of the lush grandeur here in the King's Garden is patlahuac
trees.  These trees are a domestic species.  They are nonflowering,
reproducing instead by vegetative propagation.  This means that they
share a common root system, with one single plant sending up trees for
mekillot lengths from this spot.  What makes them a favored plant for the
Gardens is the shade they supply.

King's Garden, Near a Boulevard~
     At this point a few rings of carefully pruned tlahtlacahui bushes
ring a couple of rock gardens.  A bored looking-guard or two is usually
stationed here, not so much to prevent someone from disturbing the
patterns in the rock garden, as to prevent someone from steeling any of
the precious tlahtlacahui fruit.  These fruit are regarded as a delicacy
throughout Athas.  The tastiest part of the fruit is the seeds.  Perhaps
the most memorable feature of the King's Gardens is the grove of Wailing
Bushes.  Often mentioned in legend, Wailing Bushes are usually regarded
by peasants in distant lands to be a myth.  Only visitors to Tyr will get
to behold their leaf covered switches and to know the truth.  While
perhaps they were at one time common, the King's Garden may in fact
contain the last surviving population of this rare plant in Athas.  Each
bush sometimes makes a sound that does indeed sound somewhat like a
human, or an elf mournfully wailing.  To the east the view is of the
road.  The twain are seperated by only a thin wooden fence.  A couple of
sleepy-looking guards are usually on duty to prevent elves from wandering
in .  Most of the persons travelling through this part of the city are
merchant class or noble class, or the manifold slaves of one of these
wealthy persons.

     This is one of the major thoroughfares of Tyr.  The passersby
here represeent a true cross-section of Tyrian life.  Most of the
pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and

Ethnic Neighborhood, South of a Market~
     The architectures of this region have a markedly different aspect
from the buildings of the rest of Tyr.  It's not that the commoners who
live here have a tremendous choice of materials.  For the most part, they
use the same adobe bricks as the other Tyrians.  However, they
incorporate more stone blocks into their design, and the neighborhood
certainly has it's own flavor.  After one's eyes adjust to the variety of
species, the next thing one notices are the varieties of humans that make
their home here.  Dark-skinned northerners can be spotted, their posture
formal.  Travelers from the far desert congregate as well, their robes as
white as limestone.  The air is split with the language of more than a
dozen languages.  A few sound almost song-like, invoking tones to enhance
meaning.  Others favor clicking sounds to punctuate words.  A few of the
men and women, representatives of very lively cultures, are jovial even
when they are sober, and seem almost frantic compared to some of the more
reserved Tyrians.

tend to favor the use of more earthy, strong spices in their cuisine.  The

memory, or his mouth water if they are used to it.

Slave Pits~
     This is the infamous slave pits of Tyr.  By reputation they are a
terrible place to live.  There is little privacy, little shelter except
for a bunch of tents.  Guards keep a fairly tight watch on the slave
quarters, to prevent quarreling.  The tents that store food are
particularly well-guarded.  Although slaves are usually particularly
tired after their days work, they enjoy a certain degree of freedom to
indulge in gambling, sexual recreation and to sing songs.

Ethnic Neighborhood, South of a Market~
     This neighborhood is filled with a variety of people.
Half-giants, elves and dwarves walk alongside mul, halfbreeds, and
thri-keen.  A few foul-smelling individuals can be spotted in the crowd,
cloaks wrapped tightly about them to conceal their features.  These
bestial humanoids could conceivably be gith or lizardmen, but few persons
draw close enough to them to get a good look.  The architectures of this
region have a markedly different aspect from the buildings of the rest of

of this can be attributed to the influence of Nibonese cooking.  They
tend to favor the use of more earthy, strong spices in their cuisine.  The
effect on the passerby is either to make his or her mouth burn from the
memory, or his mouth water if they are used to it.  Although this
neighborhood is quite eclectic in character, it most certainly is not an
example of racial harmony.  Quarrels break out periodically, often
motivated by ethnic misunderstandings.  A couple of seriously mean gangs
make these city- blocks their territory, and the area is unsafe to walk
alone after dark.

Military Compound -- Rec Yard~
     This patch of groomed sand is the recreation yard for this
mercenaries' compound.  The yard is ringed with a low brick wall,
presumably to prevent vagrants from wandering in.  Some of the
mercenaries lounging around the yard are fairly surly looking.  A few
groups of them can be spotted at most hours of the day, usually gambling
or drinking.

Slave Pits~
     This is the infamous slave pits of Tyr.  By reputation they are a
terrible place to live.  There is little privacy, little shelter except
for a bunch of tents.  Guards keep a fairly tight watch on the slave
quarters, to prevent quarreling.  The tents that store food are
particularly well-guarded.  Although slaves are usually particularly
tired after their days work, they enjoy a certain degree of freedom to
indulge in gambling, sexual recreation and to sing songs.

Lyemaker's Yard~
     The slaves working here are somewhat relaxed compared to slaves
working in some of the other work areas.  For a field slave, lyemaking
could be considered light duty.  One problem is that lye does have a
tendency to eat at the skin, leaving many of the workers with itchy
rashes.  This open area has a lot of barrels set up, tended by slaves.
The slaves line the barrels with wood ash and improvised filters.  They
pour water through these barrels, saving the filtrate as primitive lye.
From there, some of the lye is turned into soap for sale to the richer
Tyrians.  The quality of the water used to make the lye varies depending
upon the customer, some of it quite brackish and coming from questionable
sources.  Carts of wood pull up to deliver their loads of wood ash, one
of the major ingredients in lye.

below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust of
wind, below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust

naturally segregates the particles according to their qualities.  Other
slaves measure the motion of the clay with their eyes, going to an
estimated distance from the towers to collect the best clay, which they
call Smectite.  This they sweep into more buckets, mixing it with ground
eggshell.  Nearby, other slaves mix the clay with water, kneed it, and
then form pots.  Some they create using potter's wheels, although the
less-skilled slaves make pinch pots.  They make their mark on these wet
vessels, then load them onto beast-drawn carts.  Nearby, the pottery is
fired in kilns.

Dye Worker Vats~
     The dyeing process is one of the least harsh of the works being
conducted here in the worker's fields.  Many of the slaves here seem to
have a quiet subservience to them, but do not exhibit signs of regular
abuse.  Artisans supervise their work, in addition to overseers.  Shades
huts and low brick buildings offer temporary shade for the workers here.
The fires that brew the cauldrons of the dye-makers are small, efficient
and well-kept.  Into the cauldrons go a variety of natural materials -
salts, crushed insects, animal organs, dried plants, and others less
recognizable.  These are weighed, measured and combined through esoteric
processes.  The results are primitive working dyes.  The best and most
skilled dyeing work is done elsewhere by more talented artisans.  Here,
bulk lots of dye are made that will add pigment to cheaper items.

Breweries~
     This is the brewer's district of the slave-yards.  A variety of
alcoholic beverages are produced here.  A good fraction of the product
turned out is a rich Tyrian beer.  Most of the brewing goes on inside of
brick huts.  Drunken slaves do much of the work.  Wagons pull into
various lots in the yards, unloading legumes and empty kegs, and loading
up kegs of beer.  The smell of malt emanates into the air, quite
pleasant.  Slaves walk to and fro carrying buckets of grist to be mashed
for the brew vats.

Military Compound -- Wagonyard~
     An adobe brick wall rings this wagon-yard.  The wall and the
patch of sand here are well maintained.  The yard is otherwise mostly
empty.  A couple of tiny lizards skitter across one corner of it during
sunny days, hunting for insects upon which to feed.  Sometimes a wagon or
two is here, attended by slaves, in a state of loading, unloading or
storage.

from the desert.  Trained slaves evaluate the quality of the fruits, and
pay the desert.  Trained slaves evaluate the quality of the fruits, and

presses.  Other, stronger slaves apply their muscle to the presses,
wringing out a volume of fruit oil.  The oil is used for a variety of
purposes in Tyr.  It is used in cooking, as a food supplement, to add
taste, to make preserves, for mummification, as a lubricant, a muscle
relaxant, a skin tonic, to burn in oil lamps, and even for the skin of
athletes.

Outside a Temple~
     Here lies the Temple of Kalak the Savior.  Not wanting to have
any positive attribute or quality associated with his rule, this temple
was constructed to advocate the idea that the Sorcerer King is able to
provide safety for Tyrians in a dangerous world, and is able to provide
meaning through civic duty in what would otherwise be a futile life.
Certainly, such promises are popular with the lower class of Tyr.  They
throng here to pray on the holy days.  Soldiers, officers and Templars
maintain order.

Slave Market~
     This is the largest slave market in Tyr.  Truthfully, slave
brokers come from far and wide to buy and sell chattel.  Some of the
slaves will be sold in lots between vendors.  Others go individually up
to auction blocks, where the work that they represent will go to the
highest bidder.  Some of the slaves do indeed appear sorrowful to be
subjected to this, but many of them were born slaves and cannot fathom a
life as anything other than a slave.  As such, any sorrow they might feel
might be the result of parting from a favored master.  Some slaves are
even excited at this dramatic moment of their lives, and puff their chest
out bravely when someone whom they might wish to work for inspects them.
The slaves for the most part wear shackles, and have brands designating
them as property.  Slaves vary much in terms of condition and capability.
Artisan slaves and house slaves might usually expect decent treatment.
Field slaves, by contrast, are usually slaves who have failed at other
tasks, and are doomed to a life of back-breaking toil.  According to the
lore of slaves, the worst fate they can receive is to be sold up the
road.  Slave-masters in the north of the tablelands have a reputation for
unabated cruelty.

families are broken up for individual sale.  Consequently, it's necessary
for a good number of soldiers and mercenaries to work the crowds here,
ensuring public order and proper payment of tax.

Outside a Temple~
     This temple is for the worship of the stars in the night sky.
They are certainly better appreciated by my Athasians than the harsh face
of the sun.  Most peasants ascribe the stars with supernatural import,
and the power to influence the future, personal life and world events.  In
theory, the Sorcerer King Kalak claims to be the son of the Stars.  As
such, this temple honors the many fathers of Kalak, and by association
honors the Sorcerer King Himself.  The area is usually busy with reverent
worshipers, and well guarded by soldiers and Templars.

Slave Market~
     This is the largest slave market in Tyr.  Truthfully, slave
brokers come from far and wide to buy and sell chattel.  Some of the
slaves will be sold in lots between vendors.  Others go individually up
to auction blocks, where the work that they represent will go to the
highest bidder.  Some of the slaves do indeed appear sorrowful to be
subjected to this, but many of them were born slaves and cannot fathom a
life as anything other than a slave.  As such, any sorrow they might feel
might be the result of parting from a favored master.  Some slaves are
even excited at this dramatic moment of their lives, and puff their chest
out bravely when someone whom they might wish to work for inspects them.
The slaves for the most part wear shackles, and have brands designating
them as property.  Slaves vary much in terms of condition and capability.
Artisan slaves and house slaves might usually expect decent treatment.
Field slaves, by contrast, are usually slaves who have failed at other
tasks, and are doomed to a life of back-breaking toil.  According to the
lore of slaves, the worst fate they can receive is to be sold up the
road.  Slave-masters in the north of the tablelands have a reputation for
unabated cruelty.

Potter's Wheels~
     Brick towers protrude from the ground here.  Slaves form a
"bucket-brigade" up these low tower, passing up buckets of clay-dirt from
below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust of
wind, below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust
of wind, then pour a bucket of clay over the side.  The wind action
naturally segregates the particles according to their qualities.  Other
slaves measure the motion of the clay with their eyes, going to an
estimated distance from the towers to collect the best clay, which they
call Smectite.  This they sweep into more buckets, mixing it with ground
eggshell.  Nearby, other slaves mix the clay with water, kneed it, and
then form pots.  Some they create using potter's wheels, although the
less-skilled slaves make pinch pots.  They make their mark on these wet

Outside a Temple~
     This temple commemorates Kalak's incarnation as a war god.  The
templarate who pray here maintain a devotion that celebrates the Sorcerer
King's ability to wreak destruction upon his foes, and to bring the
enemies of Tyr to their knees.  The temple itself is beautifully
constructed of stone, and decorated with statues and geometric stone
shapes.  Plenty of folk mill about here, most on their way too or from
one of the religious services.  They are mostly arraigned in their best
clothes, as the temple guards would not appreciate any signs of
disrespect.  Templars bestow benedictions upon passing folk, and slaves
maintain the area in good repair.

Royal Armory -- Magazine~
     This room is spacious, with a high ceiling.  Various pieces of
machinery are here, mostly disassembled.  They represent the intrinsic
components of battering rams, siege towers, catapults, and a host of
other engines useful in iron-age warfare.  Their construction exemplifies
the technology and the material shortages of the day - metal parts are
rare, and the designs are primitive yet efficient.

Wagonyard~

loading docks are arranged near the western edge of the yard.  A low
stone wall prevents too much sand from blowing into the eyes of anyone
standing here, except during the worst sandstorms.

Tyrian Army is done here.

Inside a Public House~
     This pub attracts persons that don't fit in at the more square
taverns of Tyr.  Plenty of elves, groups of foreigners, and the
occasional half-giant take their meals and their ale and their meals.
Surprisingly, the mood of the crowd is generally quite stern.  Most folk
here prefer to keep to their own, and are happy enough not to bother
others.  The exceptions to this are when a family will share a meal here,
or a group of caravan workers will stop in for some ale.  Then these sort
of folk will be lively among their own.  The joint is actually in
reasonable repair, and some attention is paid to the upkeep.  Seating is
comfortable, and the tables are cleaned regularly.

Caravans that travel deep into the desert meet here as well, using these
yards as a safe place to store their wagons sometimes, or to rendezvous
for their next trek.

     The granaries of Tyr are memorably recognizable structures.  They
are somewhat tear-drop shaped, allowing slaves to climb a ladder and pour
grain into a funnel at the top.  A gate near the bottom can be opened to
allow the grain to pour out.  Generally, fresh grain will be dried, then
added.  It is removed only during times of famine.  Several guards are
posted to prevent theft.  The sides of the granaries are made of small
bricks.  Rib-work supports the attenuated shape of the buildings.

portion of the room.  The air is heavy with the scent of food.

     By the empty rows of weapon racks that line the walls of this
small room, one can tell that one is in the magazine of the compound.
Anyone familiar with weapons can spot that some of the racks have been
constructed for swords, some for axes, some for bows, and some for other
varieties of weapons.  Few or no weapons are usually stored here.  Dust
collects on some of the racks.  Neither the mercenaries, nor their
officers, friends, nor slaves frequent this pace.

Market~
     A number of shaded booths are grouped in clusters wherever an
enterprising merchant can get one established.  In an era without mass
production or decent distribution of comestibles, it can certainly be
exciting to poke about and to see what deals can be struck.  The booths
offer a semblance of privacy for the vendors who sell their goods here,
or more usually their services.  Massage booths exist alongside the
booths of folk astrologers, and wholesalers who await their next customer
off of the streets.  Those less fortunate peddlers have their goods
spread out on a blanket.  A pity for them that they do not even have
shade to work in, yet woe unto him or her that tries to get the better
end of a deal from a shrewd old peddler.  Depending on how much time on
has to poke through rubbish, it is argued that one can find the most
interesting trade goods from these folk.  Children are a common sight
here in the marketplace.  To a certain extent, the marketplace is a
reasonable place to leave one's children for the day in the absence of
daycare.  Kidnappings are not that likely in broad daylight in front of a
crowd, and there is only so much trouble that youngsters can get into.
Many actually work to earn their keep, serving as delivery persons,
errand boys and girls, and lookouts.  Other less respectable children run
about in gangs, or sit about begging all day.

Market~
     During the busier hours, the throng of shoppers press into you as
you walk by.  There simply isn't enough room for everyone who wishes to
pick through all of the goods available, and haggle for a bargain.
Becoming jostled is commonplace, but no one seems to think much of this.
The exception is the occasional passing lord, whose entourage clears
space for their infrequent trips to the bazaar - using brute force when
needed.  A number of shaded booths are grouped in clusters wherever an
enterprising merchant can get one established.  In an era without mass
production or decent distribution of comestibles, it can certainly be

end of a deal from a shrewd old peddler.  Depending on how much time on
has to poke through rubbish, it is argued that one can find the most
interesting trade goods from these folk.  Children are a common sight
here in the marketplace.  To a certain extent, the marketplace is a
reasonable place to leave one's children for the day in the absence of
daycare.  Kidnappings are not that likely in broad daylight in front of a
crowd, and there is only so much trouble that youngsters can get into.
Many actually work to earn their keep, serving as delivery persons,
errand boys and girls, and lookouts.  Other less respectable children run
about in gangs, or sit about begging all day.

Market~
     During the busier hours, the throng of shoppers press into you as
you walk by.  There simply isn't enough room for everyone who wishes to
pick through all of the goods available, and haggle for a bargain.
Becoming jostled is commonplace, but no one seems to think much of this.
The exception is the occasional passing lord, whose entourage clears
space for their infrequent trips to the bazaar - using brute force when
needed.  A number of shaded booths are grouped in clusters wherever an
enterprising merchant can get one established.  In an era without mass
production or decent distribution of comestibles, it can certainly be
exciting to poke about and to see what deals can be struck.  The booths
offer a semblance of privacy for the vendors who sell their goods here,
or more usually their services.  Massage booths exist alongside the
booths of folk astrologers, and wholesalers who await their next customer
off of the streets.  Those less fortunate peddlers have their goods
spread out on a blanket.  A pity for them that they do not even have
shade to work in, yet woe unto him or her that tries to get the better
end of a deal from a shrewd old peddler.  Depending on how much time on
has to poke through rubbish, it is argued that one can find the most
interesting trade goods from these folk.

Alchemist's Labs~
     This area has row after row of brick buildings.  Inside of these
buildings are the primitive laboratories of alchemists.  These labs are
built here not because they require a lot of labor, so much as the fact
that the Highlord's law requires them to be built away from the rest of
the city.  This law is fitting, as the brick huts extrude a cacophony of
foul vapors.  Breathing here can at times be quite difficult.  Slaves
walk into and out of the huts at length, dumping out decanters of ichor
without thought to hygiene.  A few of the alchemists can be spotted,
depending on the time of day, often deep in discussion with each other or
deep in thought.  While one or two of them does resemble the
stereotypical wizened old man, the rest of them look more natural and to
some degree are indistinguishable from their slaves.

Kilns~
     Brick towers protrude from the ground here.  Slaves form a
"bucket-brigade" up these low tower, passing up buckets of clay-dirt from
below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust of
wind, below.  The slaves at the top of each tower wait for the right gust
of wind, then pour a bucket of clay over the side.  The wind action
naturally segregates the particles according to their qualities.  Other
slaves measure the motion of the clay with their eyes, going to an
estimated distance from the towers to collect the best clay, which they
call Smectite.  This they sweep into more buckets, mixing it with ground
eggshell.  Nearby, other slaves mix the clay with water, kneed it, and
then form pots.  Some they create using potter's wheels, although the
less-skilled slaves make pinch pots.  They make their mark on these wet
vessels, then load them onto beast-drawn carts.  Nearby, the pottery is
fired in kilns.

Tavern Row -- Soup Hall~
     This restaurant is parted into two areas.  One area is sort of a
den, set slightly lower into the ground.  Mostly commoners take their
meals here.  The raised section is slightly cleaner.  Merchants and
artisans have their meals here.  Slaves who bring coins may purchase food
as well, but must eat outside.  The most popular food here is a small
variety of soups, but other types of food, especially dishes prepared
with grains can be purchased as well.  Often, persons who come here
choose to enjoy longer meals served in a series of small courses.  Serving
lads and serving wenches attend to the customers.  All in all, it's
appropriate to have a pipe here after a meal, and the place has somewhat
of a lounge atmosphere to it.

Tavern Row -- Beer Hall~
     This is a large and lively beer hall.  Much of the room is filled
with long stone tables.  These tables are comprised of wood - a rare
enough commodity for Tyr.  The surfaces are kept to a strong sheen with a
coarse polish.  The clientele here are mostly respectable folk, to a
strong sheen with a coarse polish.  The clientele here are mostly
respectable folk, to include an assemblage of artisans, freemen,
peddlers, merchants and minor civic officials.  Although these persons
can often be quite animated with each other, they seldom appreciate the
infrequent appearance of outsiders and interlopers.  Although the beer
hall does sometimes serve food, folk come here mainly to drink.  This is
a fairly trendy place for the upwardly mobile and affluent to enjoy some
spirits.

On a Path Leading South, Outside a Bustling Kitchen~
     This kitchen is built on a path that leads towards a military
structure to the south.  The kitchen is open through a counter on one
side, where a few customers lean as they wait on their orders to be
filled.  It's easy to see the slaves in the kitchen as they hurry to
prepare simple meals.  Most of the food here will be taken by children -
delivery boys and girls who bring it to other pubs on Tavern Row who
don't always have time to do their own cooking.  A couple of benches rest
near the structure, where two or three persons sometimes take a meal if
they are in a hurry.

Tavern Row -- Public Respite~
     This is a fairly large room, constructed of adobe bricks.  Rough
pallets of grass and straw line much of the space of the room.  Here is
where poor folks sleep who cannot afford better lodging.  Many see no
shame in living like this for a short time, especially for a traveler.  A
roof over one's head and a shady place to eat are certainly nothing to
scoff at, in hard times.  The fee to stay here is quite affordable.  In
fact, the owners frequently let people stay here for free who take their
meals here, tip well, and don't cause any trouble.  It's considered bad
form to make a lot of noise, and disturb the two or three dozen persons
who sleep here.

     This room is part of the officer's quarters.  Anyone who has seen
the housing for the Regulars will notice a marked improvement in the
quality of the construction and the decor.  The atmosphere of the
officers is generally sober in conduct compared to their subordinates.
Attendants to the officers often dart about on official errands.  This
villa is spacious and pleasant.  Light filters in through a glass window.
A few low couches rest near he walls.  The rooms are clearly set up for
entertaining.  The smell of old smoke has settled into the bricks, as has
the smell of incense spices.

hang a variety of preserved beast heads, which presumably the officer who

which contains a collection of older, yet not quite valuable-looking
coins.

King's Garden, Near a Huge Gate~
     At this point a few rings of carefully pruned tlahtlacahui bushes
ring a couple of rock gardens.  A bored looking-guard or two is usually
stationed here, not so much to prevent someone from disturbing the
patterns in the rock garden, as to prevent someone from steeling any of
the precious tlahtlacahui fruit.  These fruit are regarded as a delicacy
throughout Athas.  The tastiest part of the fruit is the seeds.  Perhaps
the most memorable feature of the King's Gardens is the grove of Wailing
Bushes.  Often mentioned in legend, Wailing Bushes are usually regarded
by peasants in distant lands to be a myth.  Only visitors to Tyr will get
to behold their leaf covered switches and to know the truth.  While
perhaps they were at one time common, the King's Garden may in fact
contain the last surviving population of this rare plant in Athas.  Each
bush sometimes makes a sound that does indeed sound somewhat like a
human, or an elf mournfully wailing.  To the east the view is of the
road.  The twain are seperated by only a thin wooden fence.  A couple of
sleepy-looking guards are usually on duty to prevent elves from wandering
in .  Most of the persons travelling through this part of the city are
merchant class or noble class, or the manifold slaves of one of these
wealthy persons.

pedestrians are simply garbed and bear a moderate amount of dirt upon
their rainment and person.  Many of the passersby are slaves.  Here and
there are the rare soldier, civil employee, merchant-lord, or carriage.

Outside of a few Hawala Brokers~
     Most of the brick building here are offices.  The majority of
these offices belong to hawala brokers.  During the day, there is a small
amount of business here, as persons enter and leave the offices, to
borrow money or to make payments.  Most of the clientele is well-dressed.
At night, the area is almost deserted and the shops are locked up.  This
block is well patrolled by guards.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Third Tier~
     Construction on this tier is only partially finished.  This tier
is high enough off the ground to instill vertigo into most Athasians.  It
certainly towers over almost any other building in Tyr, with the possible
exception of King Kalak's golden tower, visible to the southwest.  Even
the ramparts of the city walls are visible below.  And yet, it's not
difficult to see that this is not the planned top of the Ziggurat.  The
foundation of more layers is laid near the center of this one.  The
center of the Ziggurat is not filled with rubble to save space, as an
engineer might expect.  Rather, it is built of a similar pattern to the
brickwork and stonework of the subordinate layers.  If anything, the
craftsmanship is more careful and the pattern more intricate near the
center.  Parts of this tier are unfinished, and it's necessary to pay
attention to where one walks.  Slaves toil all over the tier here during
the daytime.

Stadium, Commoner's Seating~
     This area has seating for commoners.  The seating is low stone
benches, without backs.  No seat numbers mark the individual spots.
During the most exciting parts of any athletic game or performance, the
area is standing room only, anyway.  Usually, these stands are empty,
except for a few guards who patrol to prevent vandalism.  On game days, a
host of peasants will be here to cheer on their favorite competitors.

Clothworker's District~
     This is one of the more bustling districts of the city.  Wagons
roll in, unloading huge bolts of fabric.  Peering in the windows of a
shop, one can see spinsters at work on some looms, working to make
fabrics out of fibers.  Slaves run back and forth carrying burdens to
their destinations.  Clothing is the most common product to come out of
this Clothworker's District.  Many other less obvious products are made
here as well, such as sails for the famed silt-skimmers, the cloths that
rider's place between a kank's saddle and it's carapace, bedrolls, and
tents, to name a few.  A huge variety of materials go into making the
garb, including hempcloth, sackcloth, burlap, gianthair, spiderhair,
animal wool, sandcloth and of course silk.

Diviner's District~
     One is now standing amidst the streets of the Diviner's District.
There are less shops per city-block here than on surrounding blocks.  In
fact, many of the houses appear to be residences.  Still, this area is
unmistakeably the area to find a diviner.  The men themselves are a
scholarly breed.  They customarily spend years of study under a master
diviner before they will have reached a level of mastery.  Even then,
they are often picky about what jobs they will take.  Theirs is certainly
something of an artist's temperment to their lifestyle.  Their craft
itself is arcane to regular folk.  The processes by which they arrive at
their results are esoteric.  Even then, diviner's practice something of
an inexact science.  Still, their work is precious to life on Athas.  No
king's reign can last without them.  Their work commands high prices.

Spy's District~
     The area surrounding this streetcorner has been nicknamed the
Spy's District.  alleged to be a good area to hire a spy.  Whether this
is true or not is a matter of some speculation.  To be fair to the area,
it is less classy than some of the neighboring streets The problem is not
with the buildings, which seem in reasonable repair, so much as it is
with the inhabitants.  There is a higher proportion of elves.  Many of
them have a conspiratorial gleam in their eye, and proffer a number of
illegal services to passersby who do not look overly respectable, or are
not wearing a guards uniform.  The guard themselves seem to avoid this
district.  A trick of a nearby hill creates a convection pattern, the
result of which is a localized heavier amount of wind.

Outside of Brick Offices~
     Most of the brick building here are offices.  The majority of
these offices belong to moneylenders.  During the day, there is a small
amount of business here, as persons enter and leave the offices, to
borrow money or to make payments.  Most of the clientele is well-dressed.
At night, the area is almost deserted and the shops are locked up.  This
block is well patrolled by guards.

Arena Floor~
     This is the floor of the Royal Stadium.  Sand lines the ground
here, freshly tilled to provide a crisp look.  The stands rise up in all
directions, with a ramp rising up to the west.  Usually, this area is
empty except for a few guards who patrol to keep vagrants from wandering
in.  On game days, this arena floor is the subject of attention from
thousands of screaming fans.

Stadium, Noble Seating~
     Seating here is somewhat more impressive than in the commoner's
area.  For one, the benches are made of a higher quality slate, and there
are backs to the seats.  Also, speaking truthfully, this area is kept
cleaner and does not have the smell of peasants.  Many of the booths are
in boxes, where a noble person or a merchant-lord can bring his family to
watch a game in comfort.  Sound quality from the arena floor is decent,
taking advantage of some of the properties of amphitheater.

Clothworker's District~
     This is one of the more bustling districts of the city.  Wagons
roll in, unloading huge bolts of fabric.  Peering in the windows of a
shop, one can see spinsters at work on some looms, working to make
fabrics out of fibers.  Slaves run back and forth carrying burdens to
their destinations.  Clothing is the most common product to come out of
this Clothworker's District.  Many other less obvious products are made
here as well, such as sails for the famed silt-skimmers, the cloths that
rider's place between a kank's saddle and it's carapace, bedrolls, and
tents, to name a few.  A huge variety of materials go into making the
garb, including hempcloth, sackcloth, burlap, gianthair, spiderhair,
animal wool, sandcloth and of course silk.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Third Tier~
     Construction on this tier is only partially finished.  This tier
is high enough off the ground to instill vertigo into most Athasians.  It
certainly towers over almost any other building in Tyr, with the possible
exception of King Kalak's golden tower, visible to the southwest.  Even
the ramparts of the city walls are visible below.  And yet, it's not
difficult to see that this is not the planned top of the Ziggurat.  The
foundation of more layers is laid near the center of this one.  The
center of the Ziggurat is not filled with rubble to save space, as an
engineer might expect.  Rather, it is built of a similar pattern to the
brickwork and stonework of the subordinate layers.  If anything, the
craftsmanship is more careful and the pattern more intricate near the
center.  Parts of this tier are unfinished, and it's necessary to pay
attention to where one walks.  Slaves toil all over the tier here during
the daytime.

Kalak's Ziggurat, Second Tier~
     This top of this tier is about six stories off of the ground -
quite high up indeed.  Construction is at an advanced state for much of
the tier.  Like the other tiers of the Ziggurat, this tier is
rectangular, proportionately so to the layer beneath it.  The Ziggurat,
then is effectively a series of concentric rectangular solids.  Slaves
work on portions of this tier, white-washing the surface until it gleams
in the sun.  Painters work on other parts, staining the bricks
decoratively.  Statues decorate parts of this level, although it would
take a connoisseur to recognize the style, perhaps influenced by elven
work.  Their subject matter invariably depicts aspects and incarnations
of the Highlord Kalak.  Some of the iconographies are fairly involved,
and their content is not immediately discernable to the reveler.

Kalak's Ziggurat, First Tier~
     This is the first Tier of Kalak's Ziggurat.  It is constructed of
a pattern of alternating adobe bricks and stone blocks.  Their geometric
pattern is almost hypnotic to view, although the components are similar
enough in hue that the subtlety is not apparent from far away.  The
blocks and the bricks fit together precisely, albeit without the benefit
of mortar.  Many of the blocks are too big for even a strong human to
lift.  Some of them weight tons.  Each tier of the ziggurat is tall in
it's own right.  One level is equivalent to about three stories of a
regular building.  This tier is nearly finished.  Artisans work here and
there, adding detail work to further beautify the Ziggurat.  Here and
there gardeners are arranging potted plants, carefully chosen for their
resistance to sand storms and sun exposure.  Slaves hustle around the
tier, busy at a variety of tasks.

New Room.~
     There are not so many royal soldiers marching these streets.  For
the most part the patricians who own these dwellings have House employed
soldiers, mercenaries, or trained slaves to look out for them.  Everyone
is much more comfortable if private security is able to attend to the
protection of these residences discreetly.  Large stone walls surround
all these residences.  The stone blocks are much sturdier and more
fashionable than brick walls.  Machicolationed battlements crest the top
of these walls, stylized provocatively.  Although the walls are usually
unmanned, they can be reassuring to the folk who live here that there is
some measure of protection from the rabble.  Outsiders to the city will
notice a curious absence of artistic decor to these houses.  Clothing on
slaves will often display an embroidered livery, and awnings will
frequently exhibit detail work.  The villas themselves even go so far as
to show gratuitous arching to their design.  But the facades themselves
are completely devoid of the fine arts - either painting, mural or
sculpture.  Music cannot be heard in the streets, neither.

Bustling Marketplace~
     Those less fortunate peddlers have their goods spread out on a
blanket.  A pity for them that they do not even have shade to work in,
yet woe unto him or her that tries to get the better end of a deal from a
shrewd old peddler.  Depending on how much time on has to poke through
rubbish, it is argued that one can find the most interesting trade goods
from these folk.  Children are a common sight here in the marketplace.  To
a certain extent, the marketplace is a reasonable place to leave one's
children for the day in the absence of daycare.  Kidnappings are not that
likely in broad daylight in front of a crowd, and there is only so much
trouble that youngsters can get into.  Many actually work to earn their
keep, serving as delivery persons, errand boys and girls, and lookouts.
Other less respectable children run about in gangs, or sit about begging
all day.  Perhaps difficult to understand is the language and behavior of
the speculators - merchants who deal at high volumes over goods and
service that are not even delivered yet.  It can be a dangerous business
likely to cost the naive a small fortune, yet a profitable one for anyone
who can plan well and has the necessary monies and influence to get
through a deal.

Tunnel Beneath Sewer Grate~
     A set of very sturdy climbing holes leads down to this crude
tunnel made from various types of stone that are constructed with a
walk-way on both sides - making someone passing through not needing to
wade through refuse.  The main groove is filled with sludge; excrement's
and garbage from the city above with only enough moisture to slowly crawl
along the tunnels.  The heat and stench here is horrid, all materials
decomposing rapidly as it travels along at the speed of a snail.  The
width of the tunnel is fairly consistently about nine to twelve feet with
slippery walk-ways between a feet or two wide.  While the roof could
allow for a rather large creature to pass walking through the sludge, the
thin walk-ways are unusable for bigger creatures then the average human.
Variation of stone and the decorations on some blocks are clear evidence
that the tunnels are built from older buildings, but the exaggeration in
solidity and massive supportive blocks and pillars shows that it is not
made in haste.  In the ceiling is seen a sewer grate leading to the
city-streets above.

Sewerdrain~
     In this larger circular room, the foul and decomposing waste
gathered from various parts of the large city of Tyr drops down a hole
into a huge stone reservoir.  The stench and vapours rising from the
great pits are visible, the air trembling with gases from the materials
rotting below.  Jagged holes cut out in the side seem to make it possible
to climb downwards.  From each of the joining sewer tunnels sludge slowly
creeps forwards through a stone snout and tumbles downwards.  Above in
the roof of the tunnel, where the supporting blocks meet - a great rune
are carved.  The side of the hole looks odd, like if has partly collapsed
down into an existing cavity.

Inn Cellar~
     This large stone-walled room smells heavily of spilt ale and
smoked meat, with its large block-like stones and dark, old wooden
ceiling it feels comforting despite its size.  In its centre is a rather
enormous wooden stairs that leads upwards, it is combined with a ramp and
a small winch to handle heavy things that needs to go up or down.  Large
barrels and wooden boxes are placed in a seemingly random fashion, and
repairs have been done on both the northern and eastern wall, placing
wooden panels over old stained stone.

Secret Cellar~
     This long but narrow room is clad mostly in dark wooden panels
besides the eastern end that is bare stone.  Panels near the western wall
seem to form a door, built as a part of the wall with hinges and bronze
taps.  The cellar is constructed in three sections; the one to the west
contains a table, some bunks and a few hooks on which to hang things
whilst the eastern part is more like an interrogation room with benches,
strapping and iron cages.  In the middle there is place for storage with
shelves and a few wooden boxes, and a thin ladder leads upwards.

Old Building~
     This partly collapsed room is the remains of some older building,
something that has been buried beneath Tyr as the glorious city grew to
power.  It is made from grey, dull stone with few decorations and has
fallen together on its east end, while the western part stands proudly
and a rough hole has been hacked up in the wall leading to the sewers.  By
the rubble lying inside the hole and the many footprints in the sand and
dust there has been some team of workers that has made a hole in from the
sewer tunnel.  Any obvious relics or things left behind has since long
been looted.

Sewer Reservoir~
     This large void, shaped roughly spherical and from many sorts of
building blocks.  Parts of old walls, pillars and statues have been
brutally cut to build this reservoir and patch up those areas where the
stone-walls of a natural cavern didn't suit the constructor's intent.  In
the approximate middle is a ledge running around the whole circumference,
and it is as the rest of the orb-shaped vault built from various
materials at hand - and from that there are climbing holes cut in the
wall going upwards.  The reservoir wall seems to have crumbled just below
the ledge on the western side, making it possible to climb downwards into
a dark orifice.  About one-quarter of this reservoir is filled with the
gathered refuse and excrement's from the city above, accumulating and
maturing for a very long time.  The smell here is horrible, and the fetid
stew below seems like a death-trap for any creature regardless of
strength or ability to swim.

Broken Reservoir Wall~
     This area is formed in several adjoining oval rooms by the water
that once might have flowed through, digging and cutting through rock and
leaving passages, gaps and cavities that are all interconnected.  Piles
and heaps of rocks in various sizes are strewn in holes and cracks, some
grinded smooth like most of the surfaces in walls, floor and ceiling.  An
eerie echo is created by the faintest of sounds.  Near the ceiling of the
western wall there is a seal made up with large sand-stones, they are
broken up at one place making it possible to climb upwards through the
jagged hole.

Sewer Drain~
     In this larger circular room, the foul and decomposing waste
gathered from various parts of the large city of Tyr drops down a hole
into a huge stone reservoir.  The stench and vapours rising from the
great pits are visible, the air trembling with gases from the materials
rotting below.  Jagged holes cut out in the side seem to make it possible
to climb downwards.  From each of the joining sewer tunnels sludge slowly
creeps forwards through a stone snout and tumbles downwards.  Above in
the roof of the tunnel, where the supporting blocks meet - a great rune
are carved.

Sewer Tunnel~
     This crude tunnel made from various types of stone, are
constructed with a walk-way on both sides - making someone passing
through not needing to wade through refuse.  The heat and stench here is
horrid, all materials decomposing rapidly as it travels along at the
speed of a snail.  The width of the tunnel is fairly consistently about
nine to twelve feet with slippery walk-ways between a feet or two wide.
While the roof could allow for a rather large creature to pass walking
through the sludge, the thin walk-ways are unusable for bigger creatures
then the average human.  Variation of stone and the decorations on some
blocks are clear evidence that the tunnels are built from older
buildings, but the exaggeration in solidity and massive supportive blocks
and pillars shows that it is not made in haste.

Sewer Drain~
     In this larger circular room, the foul and decomposing waste
gathered from various parts of the large city of Tyr drops down a hole
into a huge stone reservoir.  The stench and vapours rising from the
great pits are visible, the air trembling with gases from the materials
rotting below.  Jagged holes cut out in the side seem to make it possible
to climb downwards.  From each of the joining sewer tunnels sludge slowly
creeps forwards through a stone snout and tumbles downwards.  Above in
the roof of the tunnel, where the supporting blocks meet - a great rune
are carved.

Sewer Reservoir~
     This large void, shaped roughly spherical and from many sorts of
building blocks.  Parts of old walls, pillars and statues have been
brutally cut to build this reservoir and patch up those areas where the
stone-walls of a natural cavern didn't suit the constructor's intent.  In
the approximate middle is a ledge running around the whole circumference,
and it is as the rest of the orb-shaped vault built from various
materials at hand - and from that there are climbing holes cut in the
wall going upwards.  About one-third of this reservoir is filled with the
gathered refuse and excrement's from the city above, accumulating and
maturing for a very long time.  The smell here is horrible, and the fetid
stew below seems like a death-trap for any creature regardless of
strength or ability to swim.

dark-grey rock with great skill or perhaps even magical means, it slopes
downwards from the west and the floor is very slippery from the refuse
that has passed this way.  The stench is very bad, and the remains of
what has been tossed down the sewers blotches the fine craftsmanship of
the men making the shaft.

     Cut through dull dark-grey stone there is a pipe formed as a
narrow circular passage, it is barely two and a half feet in diameter and
stinks of human waste, blood and whatever unholy that could be tossed
down to be lost in the cities sewage.  In a circle that repeats itself
every five feet, glyphs and runes of an arcane origin that has been cut
into the stone marks this passage.  Even a small human would have to

from a lewd dark-grey pool of rotting fluids into which the passage dips
into.  From here it is impossible to see what happens with the tunnel,
and proceeding westwards would mean submersing oneself completely into

Fetid Pool~
     Fluids from the great pile of corpses and garbage that rises as a
small hill to the north has run down a gentle slope and gathered down
here in a groped hole.  The pool rests with its deepest end against the
eastern wall, it is very murky but one can see that there seems to be a
passage leading eastwards beneath the surface.  This area seems
originally to have been a natural cavern that has been improved on and
some pillars have been placed to support the southern ceiling.  On the
walls there are a few very simple and crude carvings and marks showing
death-motives such as skulls and rotting bodies.

     A rather long but gentle slope curve itself here from the north
to the east, it is a natural cavern through the mountain with heaps of
rocks and stalagmites as well as stalactites decorating the area.
Seemingly random laid out around the slope are pieces of corpses or small
pieces of clothing, equipment among other soiled and broken trinkets.
More then a few small mushrooms grow on the slimy stone, and the air is
filled with the smell of corruption and decomposition.

this part of the cavern is formed in several adjoining oval rooms by the

rock and leaving passages, gaps and cavities that are all interconnected.
Piles and heaps of rocks in various sizes are strewn in holes and cracks,
some grinded smooth like most of the surfaces in walls, floor and

spread out from the mound of corpses in the east - the smell of rotting
flesh is rancid.

fifty feet in diameter and rising to half that where it in the roof is
added a man-made round hole lined with death-like carvings that leads

spotted with stalagmites, stalactites and large stone blocks while to the
south a slope leads down into a fetid pool.  At several places along the
walls of this chamber there are markings and statue-like carvings
decorating the walls, they show mostly descriptions of death such as
corpses and skeletons - but also people in pain and agony.

Natural Cavern~
     This area is formed in several adjoining oval rooms by the water
that once might have flowed through, digging and cutting through rock and
leaving passages, gaps and cavities that are all interconnected.  Piles
and heaps of rocks in various sizes are strewn in holes and cracks, some
grinded smooth like most of the surfaces in walls, floor and ceiling.  An
eerie echo is created by the faintest of sounds.

Steep Slope~
     A steep slope leads upwards here, seeming the caverns above has
collapsed into this area, and the slope been created by water running
through.  Against the slope someone has started the work of making stairs
leading upwards, but abandoned that and simply hacked up holes along the
wall - quite enough to climb upwards.  The area itself is part of a
system of smaller caves, all groped out by precious water in some age
long past.

Small Pool~
     Against the eastern wall lies a small pool of water, the air here
cool and smells of stagnant moisture, walls and a few rocks even gleam of
humidity.  Some moss and the occasional pale mushroom struggles for
survival on the stone on this natural cavern, formed in several adjoining
oval rooms by the water that once flowed through here.  In the pool
itself some green algae and particles of dust line the surface, making
the water seem like a dark and dirty mirror.  The pool is only a few
steps across, but its murky water makes it hard to judge its depth - and
slowly but consistently drops falls from the wall into the pool creating
a gentle, echoing sound through the cave.

Steep Slope~
     In a rather large area of natural caverns, dominated by loose
piles of rock and interconnected smooth oval spaces cut open in mostly
grey stone there is a steep slope leading downwards into other caverns.
The hole looks like if some part of the caverns floor collapsed and a
slope been smoothed out by flowing water - later additions are climbing
holes hacked into the slope and the old, rotten remains of some wood and
bone contraption to hoist heavy loads up and down the hole.  There is
moisture in the air and the stagnant smell of old water.

Mushroom Groove~
     In a large area of natural caverns that has been improved upon
and supported with a few stone pillars grows clusters of mushrooms in
shades from white to grey.  They grow in heights up to a foot in a mix of
the remains from mouldy and rotten timber, combined with the excrement's
of the animals that comes here to eat.  Clouds of miniscule insects fly
around, making a vague background noise.  Tracks of smaller animals and
half-eaten mushrooms are spread across the area yielding further evidence
of life.

Buried Ruin~
     A larger building in stone that has crumbled in the centre still
functions as a bent tunnel through the rubble and fallen stones.  Repairs
have been made - the roof as been supported by some crude stone pillars
and fallen stones has been dragged away.  Despite the work at making the
buried ruin into a passageway of sorts, the whole building looks unstable
with its many cracks running along the stone.  There are still shattered
remains that show that the room has once been in use, shards of ceramics
and splinters of ancient wood can be seen on the floor.

Narrow Path~
     Wedged between the walls of some ancient buildings that been
buried beneath the city of Tyr a narrow path winds its way north and
south.  It consists mainly what could have been a very meagre passageway
between buildings and a piece of rough tunnel.  The part that is a rough
tunnel with one wall of dirt and crumbled blocks of stone, and one wall
of broad stone squares is the most southern part of the path.

Ancient Street~
     This broad tunnel that goes through the underground looks like a
main street in some older city, built over centuries ago.  It is clear
that parts of the street have collapsed, and some construction taken
place - clearing up space and placing supporting blocks of stone and the
occasional pillar.  The air smells dry and despite marks in the sand and
dirt of the floor, the buried street feels old and deserted.  On all
sides of the streets are the walls and remains of buildings, most of them
made inaccessible by heaps of stone or have caved in and been crushed
from the pressure of stone, earth and sand.

Temple Entrance~
     A wide but low tunnel leads northwards, great cracks and rifts is
drawn across the large blocks of dark-red stone that make up the walls,
roof and floor.  The northern part of the tunnel is lit by some kind of
unnatural dull red glow, making the use of torches unnecessary.  On the
floor there is deeply cut markings that in an abstract manner shows
females with various strange attributes such as snake tails, scorpion
stingers, claws, horns and male phalluses.  The markings are partially
covered in sand and dirt, but is fairly untoutched by time and wear.
Further north the roof is lowered, forcing anyone that wants to pass to
crawl in on their belly - anyone significantly larger then a man would
have great troubles getting through.

Temple Hall~
     This huge hall contains a feeling of awe and dread, the arced
roof with its shadows and figurines creates a visual illusion seeming to
arc a hundred feet in the air.  A strange dull red glow creates long
shadows without any clear origin, making torches or lanterns useless.
While some of the exits has caved in, the main hall is unblemished and
without damages.  In the southern end where any visitor is forced to
crawl inside a heavy bone grid is hung; making it impossible to stand
anywhere in the first south-quarter of the chamber.  The middle of the
hall contains low stone benches, with room for hundreds of people.  All
made in the same dark-red stone they are formed in a semicircle around a
platform that is raised three feet from the floor and that is shaped like
a square against the northern wall.  On a few shallow steps one can
proceed up on the platform, to the sacrificial altar.  Motives showing
obscure female-like creatures are artistically carved into the stone all
over the great room.
